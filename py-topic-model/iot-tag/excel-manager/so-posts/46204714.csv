Please refer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-device-management-overview" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Overview of device management with IoT Hub</a>, in this article there is introduction about Azure IoT Hub. </p>		<blockquote>	  <ol start="2">	  <li>Or Should I make my web app only to manage (add\edit\del..) devices </li>	  <li>Or is there any better option in Azure to manage device that send data to be placed on the Azure resource?</li>	  </ol>	</blockquote>		<p>The repository of <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Microsoft Azure IoT SDK for .NET</a> contains IoT service SDKs, you can use this SDK in you web app to manage the devices.The basic features of the tool <strong>DeviceExplorer</strong>  in this repository are similar with your requirements, such as device management, receiving message from devices, sending data to devices by call method on devices. Even though, this tool is a desktop application, you can try to transplant the features in web app.</p>	"

I am looking at how microsoft updates and installs apps through the default app so that i might add an updater to my app. There is no way to update app since there is no store to update on IOT. So the next logical thing would be manually but i have to see how they do it in order to get an idea on how i can approach the updating. I know i can update the app through the default app or visual studio but i want my app to check and update itself. Also down voting without comment shouldn't be allowed."

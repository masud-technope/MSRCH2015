I need any hint :) 	thank u for all.  </p>	"

I have multiple Raspberry Pi in the same network so I cannot use TCP 	is the HTTP can return data from server?	if I send a message to the server and server found any update in the database can it return these date as a response to specific Raspberry Pi that had been sent this message"

The Raspberry Pi can be a web server that allows user to input data on the website, and process it and save it to a database. Are you having the problem on the web server part or on the database management part?"

If successful in this attempt then you can access disk drive folders inside the server. In the webpage running on server ,make it listen for certain values and write the status to a text file or an database. Then make RPi to continuously monitor those file for data updation and make it work according to it.</p>	"

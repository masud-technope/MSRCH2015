How can i reach, with an host, a server for example cloudmqtt to solve this problem and have an online broker? i can try this solution?"

I just got 2 hosts, 1 switch and 1 controller, on xterm of the host1 if i type "service mosquitto status" seems to work, it's online, but when i try to do "mosquitto_sub -h "what ip i need to use?"		Thanks  a lot!"

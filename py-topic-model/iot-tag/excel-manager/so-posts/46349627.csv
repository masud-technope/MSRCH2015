But it's not similar to common update because I don't want to publish to market and some reasons below. The idea is the app check version through server, if it's old, then download a file to proceed update.</p>		<ul>	<li><p>This is not an overwritten installation, only some parts of the app is changed, not all.</p></li>	<li><p>The app have to keep working during updating.</p></li>	<li><p>The download and update process must be silent, there must be no notification, pop-up or asking permission (option)</p></li>	</ul>		<p>Please tell me if it 's possible and give me advice, approach, keywords, ideas or somethings helpful. Do I have to intervene system, OS or anything?. I tend to make the phone as a sensor device</p>	"

You can't just download few part of it.</p>		<p>but what you can do is download app in background without user interaction.</p>		<p>Now to install this user has to allow installation as per security standards.</p>		<p>PS: If you just want to perform different action. You can download stuff n place in external/internal storage and through api call changes perform desire actions.</p>		<p>There are apps that doesn't use play store for updation eg.

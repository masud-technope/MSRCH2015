If someone is allowed to subscribe one topic, it must be allowed to receive a message published to that topic.</p>		<p>Another approach is to specify the exact topics to subscribe and use everything wildcard (*) for Receive action. If someone is allowed to subscribe a list of topics, it will never receive messages from other topics, so why bother to specify the exact topics in Receive actions too?</p>		<p>The only use case when Receive should be different from Subscribe is when an already connected and subscribed thing/user must be disallowed to receive messages publish to one topic already subscribed. However this is a very particular situation.</p>	"

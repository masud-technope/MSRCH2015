Now the problem is that, for better security and privacy, Android App should detect only my ESP8266 for <code>smartConfig</code>. Means, Android App should not detect and transmit any data packages(should not give SSID and Password) to any other esp8266 which is not mine. Which protocol or method should I follow? I am coding in ArduinoIDE.</p>		<p>I have already used most popular <code>smartConfig</code> Android App<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cmmakerclub.iot.esptouch&amp;hl=en_IN" rel="nofollow noreferrer">[1]</a> for trial and got succeed<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qAxsi.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">[2]</a>. But still can't decide how to detect only my own ESP8266 (no any other esp8266) via Android app for the same smartConfig method.</p>		<p>I have also seen so many links and chats for UDP broadcast packets and successfully tried it for ESP8266 and UDP sender/receiver AndroidApp<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jca.udpsendreceive&amp;hl=en_IN" rel="nofollow noreferrer">[3]</a>. But it can be helpful only when ESP and Android will be in the same LOCAL network. And for my case, ESP8266 will not have SSID and Password before smartConfig.</p>		<p>I am expecting this matter is limited to the UDP packets[broadcast] only. If not then, how other professional smart devices are configured to be scanned and connect with their own mobile App..? I mean, some professional App can only scan and connect with their own specific devices, not with any other devices for <code>smartConfig</code>.</p>	"

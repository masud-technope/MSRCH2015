I have succcessfully created an IotHub, and a provisioning service in Azure and created an enrollment group with a self-signed X509 Certificate.  </p>		<p>My goal is to install a custom application on every device that when started, will auto-provision the device to my IoT Hub and let the application specify the DeviceID to use. 	Windows devices have a guid in the registry we can use for identification. I would love to use this guid as the device identifier</p>		<p>I can successfully auto-provision devices from the client by following this SDK:  <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-samples-csharp/tree/master/provisioning/Samples/device" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-samples-csharp/tree/master/provisioning/Samples/device</a></p>		<p>The problem is I do not know how to specify the DeviceID from the client device when I am provisioning it.</p>		<p>Is this not possible due to security reasons, or maybe it is not yet a feature?</p>	"

(e.g. If the subject is     <code>CN=mydevice O=Contoso C=US</code>, the RegistrationID and DeviceID will be mydevice.) The name must respect the DeviceID naming constraints.</p>		<p>One option is to use X509 certificate with GUID (from windows devices example: <code>CN=GUID O=Contoso C=US</code>) in CN part that is chained to your Group Enrollment certificate.</p>	"

I have gone through Kaa Basic DataCollection Demo and Created Kaa Sample Application, compiled and Run on Linux with Kaa IoT C SDK.	As of now I have learned Kaa IoT Endpoint SDK Application. I want to extend the project for Multiple Endpoint interfaced with a Center Gateway(Actor Gateway), and want Gateway to communicate with Kaa IoT Server. Im want to use RaspberryPi as Actor Gateway and Modbus devices as an EndPoints.	I have searched for it and found some information(<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43704357/actor-gateway-for-kaa-server-java-based">Actor Gateway for Kaa Server - Java based</a> ,<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40814099/building-java-based-kaa-actor-gateway">Building Java based Kaa actor gateway</a>) which gives basic idea about the approach but not any example code to get started.</p>		<p>I need to understand that How I can register Endpoints from single Kaa IoT SDK Application and manage Endpoints.</p>		<p>Any comments which can show forward path are highly appreciable.</p>	"

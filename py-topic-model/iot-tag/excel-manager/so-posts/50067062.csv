I kept getting an error saying "<strong>[IoT hub Client] Connect error: undefined</strong>", but I got everything working from home using the same device connection string and I am able to see messages in IoT Hub.</p>		<p>What am I missing? </p>		<p>I use IE at work and the work machines have to use a proxy to connect to the internet. Is this causing the issue? </p>		<p>Any help is very much appreciated.</p>		<p>URL for Raspberry Pi Web Simulator - <a href="https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/#GetStarted" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/#GetStarted</a></p>	"

You can track a known issue(<a href="https://github.com/Azure/iothub-explorer/issues/17" rel="nofollow noreferrer">#17</a>) on GitHub. And you can test it with not in proxy environment.</p>	"

Then each independent unit can connect via bluetooth. But i am not sure if it is good idea or not. How will they all connect to single device.</p>		<p>Idea is like 10 arduino device sending and receiving signal from one iphone or Ipad.</p>	"

Your Ipad already has bluetooth."

Now as next step i want to connect all these component wirelessly with Ipad so i questioned if it is possible. I do understand motor etc is not senor. It was mistake from my side to mention them as sensor. As an example 5 temperature sensors placed in  5 rooms but reporting to one device, which can send and receive instruction."

Well battery consumption depends on the code.  sleep mode power consumption and active mode power consumption and battery capacity! consider https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-battery-life"

Now as next part of learning is to connect multiple adruino with single ipad so i questioned is it possible? Which unfortunately no one answered."

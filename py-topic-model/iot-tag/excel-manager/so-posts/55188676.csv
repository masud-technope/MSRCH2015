The blockchain usage is a requirement from my thesis supervisor and I have huge problem with finding out how blockchain technology may be useful in home automation.</p>		<p>What I have already considered is that there are two types of blockchain which I can use: private and public.</p>		<p>The public blockchain won't be useful at all, because of long time to achieve consensus and every transaction costs money (fee for miners).</p>		<p>I also don't see any adventage of private blockchain over regular database in such application. There are two reasons:</p>		<p>-I won't be able to store blockchain on every smart home device, because they all have limited space. So If I need to store blockchain in some centralised way, I think it looses it's immutability adventage.</p>		<p>-The public key cryptography is a very nice thing, but I can archieve that also in a regular database, so I don't see the need to implement blockchain for that.</p>		<p>So am I not seeing something? How use of blockchain may be helpful is such a small project?</p>		<p>Thanks in advance for any advice! :)</p>	"

There are blockchains out there which have a focus for devices with small storage, for example, IOTA. </p>		<p>As far as I understand you are looking for a solution that doesn't have a SPoF (Single Point of Failure) and which is decentralized, without using the storage of the device.  </p>		<p>Personally, I think BigChainDB (<a href="https://www.bigchaindb.com/developers/getstarted/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.bigchaindb.com/developers/getstarted/</a>) can be the best solution for you. Setup some nodes and let the devices authenticate with it though MongoDB or simplify it with API access. It's a great base for deploying decentralized applications, such as yours. </p>	"

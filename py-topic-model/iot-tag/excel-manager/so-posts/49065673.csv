For example if I â€‹ask alexa to turn on the device, and if the the power of the device is off or the device is disconnected from the internet, I want Alexa to say the device is not responding. I can't think of a way, could anyone help?</p>	"

So if you send back an "ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE" response she is going to say "xxx is not responding" which is the built in response for that error type. If on the other hand your'e building a Custom skill then the responses are entirely up to you.	see:	<a href="https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smarthome/issues/19" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smarthome/issues/19</a></p>	"

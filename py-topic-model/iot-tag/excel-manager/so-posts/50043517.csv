I am able to collect UDP packets send to the current node, but still unable to receive packets send between other nodes in my communication range.</p>	"

There are multiple layers in an OS network stack, of which the radio driver is only the first one. The next ones are RDC and MAC, which still filter out packets addressed to other nodes, and there is no API to disable that.</p>		<p>The solution is to either modify the MAC to disable dropping of packets not addressed to the local mode or write your own simple MAC. The latter is what the Sensniff (Contiki packet sniffer) <a href="https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/tree/develop/examples/sensniff" rel="nofollow noreferrer">does - see its README and source code</a>. By the way, if you just want to log all received packets, just use Sensniff!</p>	"

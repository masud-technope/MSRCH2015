How do we really identify whether a device is IoT enabled and security assesment needs to be done. Like example, if we look at Johnson &amp; Johnson or Baxter .. they build medical devices but how do we know it's an IoT and related security to be addressed. Any kind of information and guidance would be of great help. Thanks :)</p>	"

Additionally, this is **off topic** on Stackoverflow as it is a *usage* question and not a *software development* question."

Typically knock offs will occur(or its just plain OEM'ed from china) and will prob show up on places like alibaba. Within the listings of alibaba you can see if they list or you can email the supplier and ask if they use dhawa,  hisilicon or any of the other IoT boards in their product.   </p>	"

Do you mean (kaa notifications)[http://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Using+notifications]? You can filter your devices to (endpoint groups)[http://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Using+endpoint+groups] that can have different configurations and notification topics, what allows you to treat EP differently by condition matches."

I don't know exactly but I think we need to have a controller to control and check conditions in server side. I know how is it done using configuration and events in client side but I'm trying to do that in server side, How could this condition be checked in server side? I'm from AWS IOT background so I'm searching similar rule engine here."

Today one is going to release 0.10.0 version and after that Kaa crew will start working on 1.0.0. Now you can use [REST log appender](http://kaaproject.github.io/kaa/docs/v0.10.0/Programming-guide/Key-platform-features/Data-collection/Rest-log-appender/) and analyze data in your external system or create [custom log appender](http://kaaproject.github.io/kaa/docs/v0.10.0/Customization-guide/Customizable-system-components/Log-appenders/) with necessary processing logic."

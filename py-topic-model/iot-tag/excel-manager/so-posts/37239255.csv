I've installed moaquitto broker from this website.</p>		<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mosquitto/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eclipse.org/mosquitto/download/</a></p>		<p>and done with simple subscribe/publish using paho eclipse library in java.	then I created X509 certificates using bouncycastle in java.	but now I am stuck at server configurations regarding these certificates.I need to use different certificates for different topics on same broker.	What I found is the following mosquitto-auth-plug.</p>		<p><a href="https://github.com/jpmens/mosquitto-auth-plug" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jpmens/mosquitto-auth-plug</a></p>		<p>But here  in mosquitto_auth_plugin we need to  define backend databases holding username and password for authentication. How can we save certificates here? as I stated above I am creating X509 rootCA for server and X509 certificates for client.I am quit confused about it.</p>		<p>Is there any other/better way to acknowledge server regarding these certificates? Can this purpose be achieved using anyother broker like HiveMQ,ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ?</p>	"

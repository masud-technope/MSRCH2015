I am using pymodbus to connect to the device, and some LEDs are connected so I'm able to write to the coil and light them up.</p>		<p>I am using the code below:</p>		<pre><code>import time	import logging	logging.basicConfig()	log = logging.getLogger()	log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)		from pymodbus.client.sync import ModbusTcpClient as ModbusClient		client = ModbusClient('x.x.x.x', port=502)	client.connect()		client.write_coil(2, True, unit=1)	client.write_coil(2, False, unit=1)	</code></pre>		<p>This turns the LED on and off, and if I increase the first number it lights up the next one etc. HOWEVER, the problem is that I cannot access the slave unit and its coils. </p>		<p>In the admin panel I have checked the "Enable Modbus/TCP Slave Protocol" but I do not have a unit ID nor address to the slave unit. The slave is connected to the master through an ethernet cable, and the master is connected to the network through another ethernet cable. </p>		<p>I have googled my brains out, but can't find where to get hold of the ID? </p>	"

53106048,93107745,53106048,3,0,Thu Nov 01 17:20:00 EDT 2018,2868900,"Yes, I am able to connect to the modbus and log into the MOXA web interface admin panel and set modbus addressing. In the interface the "Enable Modbus/TCP Slave Protocol" is enabled, and I have given the box an IP-address to which I'm connecting to from the python script"
53106048,93108182,53106048,3,0,Thu Nov 01 17:34:00 EDT 2018,3992933,"Can you access it over Modbus specifically outside of Python, not just the web interface. I've never used Modbus, but taking I2C as an example I have used, I can check a device is there with `i2cdetect`."

This is how the device details look like: </p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FAiDe.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FAiDe.jpg" alt="Device details"></a></p>		<p>When following the steps on Microsoft's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorial</a> everything works like a charm with the temperature sensor example, which makes me guess the issue comes from my custom image URI pushed to Docker. In such field I've copied the address in the shape of <code>docker pull dockerhubname/container:module</code>, which I'm not entirely certain of.</p>		<p>Any clue on what could be wrong?

However, you're using Azure Container registry and the container address is a "proper" address, which I'm not sure how to get from docker... any idea about that? I don't think 'docker pull dockerhubname/container:module' is the proper one"

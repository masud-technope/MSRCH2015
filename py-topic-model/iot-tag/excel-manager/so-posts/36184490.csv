My service will start at the boot up and it will connect to the public broker of HiveMQ with port 1883 .</p>		<p>The problem is after connecting my Android device running my custom AOSP to the server and if i try to connect another client from the android application which is running on a phone. The client in the snapdragon board automatically disconnects from the server. when i try to reconnect it is connecting to the server again.</p>		<p>I use different client Id and user names while connecting to the server</p>	"

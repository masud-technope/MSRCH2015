Also I know it is possible to publish it to your own web application, but again, it is an external application.	Does azure have any internal "on-portal" tools to do the same.</p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

It supports Azure IoT Hub or EventHubs as a source. In the IoT Hub you should configure a separate consumer group (Endpoints/EventEndpoints). TSI supports JSON as serialization format.

I have to send some sensors data to azure iot suite's remote monitoring application for monitoring and control. We can not provide ethernet or wifi at the site. The only option is using gsm/gprs module. I have searched a lot but couldn't find any material about this. 	And would it be possible to achieve this using arduino instead of rpi.</p>	"

Now I am thinking about using some 3g USB dongle from some cellular provider. May I be able to find driver for any of these dongles or I would have to start learning Linux now."

Devices send stock info	Devices sending quality info.	Devices sending security info.	Devices sending fire safety info.</p>		<p>Each of the above category devices send versatile data in versatile format. In this scenario is it a best option to configure multiple IOT hubs or one IOT hub is suffice.</p>		<p>Thanks in Advance....</p>	"

You can still connect all the devices to one IoT Hub and then <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c" rel="nofollow noreferrer">route</a> the telemetry data, for example <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-routing-query-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">based on on device properties</a>, to different downstream processing steps.</p>		<p>You might still want to use multiple IoT Hubs but mainly then for either scaling reasons or for geographical distribution.</p>	"

So What I understand is multiple iot hubs are required either when go for scaling or we want to have IOT hubs geographically co located with IOT devices. In my scenario I can configure IOT routes to separate the telemetry based on the device type."
57305430,101108744,57305592,3,0,Thu Aug 01 11:39:00 EDT 2019,1537195,"yes. Regarding scaling, one IoT Hub can scale to millions of messages so when you just start with it, you are probably safe for a while with just one instance"
57305430,101293468,57305592,3,0,Thu Aug 08 06:20:00 EDT 2019,2522782,"One million devices is the standard limit. You can get that increased by request. Routing may help here but you will need to pay for those endpoints. Alternatively you could pipe it all into a single application and have it decide what to do with each message."

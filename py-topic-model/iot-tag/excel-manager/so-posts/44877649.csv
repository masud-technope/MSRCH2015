My objective is to make 2 MQTT clients communicate over the Mosquitto broker, so I have installed the code below on two ESP8266 (WeMos D1 mini)	and I have created this MQTT command: <code>mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.1.20 -t /wassim/led -m "on"</code>.</p>		<p>So, when I connect only one ESP client, I see  the message "on" in the serial monitor. But when I connect the second ESP client, I can't see any message on the serial monitor... (But if on the terminal of the Raspberry, then I can see everything. On the clients I can't see anything). The code:</p>		<pre><code>#include &lt;ESP8266WiFi.h&gt;	#include &lt;WiFiClient.h&gt;	#include &lt;MQTTClient.h&gt;		float temp;	float lm;	String aw="";	const char* host = "192.168.1.20";	const char* ssid = "THOMSON1121";	const char* password = "Wassim";	WiFiClient net;	MQTTClient mqtt;		void connect();		void setup() {	  Serial.begin(115200);	  Serial.println();	  Serial.println("Booting...");	  WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP_STA);	  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);	  mqtt.begin(host, net);	  connect();	  if(mqtt.subscribe("/wassim/led")) {	    Serial.println("Subscription Valid !");	  }	  Serial.println("Setup completed...");	}		void loop() {	  if (!mqtt.connected()) {	    connect();	  }	  mqtt.loop();	  delay(3000);	}		void connect() {	  while(WiFi.waitForConnectResult() != WL_CONNECTED) {	    WiFi.begin(ssid, password);	    Serial.println("WiFi connection failed. Retry.");	  }	  Serial.print("Wifi connection successful - IP-Address: ");	  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());	  while (!mqtt.connect(host)) {	    Serial.print(".");	  }	  Serial.println("MQTT connected!");	}		void messageReceived(String topic, String payload, char * bytes, unsigned int length) {	  Serial.print("incoming: ");	  Serial.print(topic);	  Serial.print(" - ");	  Serial.print(payload);	  Serial.println();	}	</code></pre>		<p>The change from one client to another is <code>if(mqtt.subscribe("/wassim/tmp"))</code>.</p>	"

44877649,45024864,44877649,2,0,Tue Jul 11 03:28:00 EDT 2017,8111821,"<p>MQTT is a 'message bus' application....in order to have multiple 'subscribers' receive the same message that is being put on the bus by a 'publisher', they both have to subscribe to the same topic...or at least enough of the topic + wildcard...in order to get sent that published message.   You only have one of your two clients listening to the topic that your 'mosquitto_pub' command is sending out. For it to receive, you either specify the full topic (<code>mqtt.subscribe("/wassim/led")</code>), or a wildcard to pick up all the 'wassim' messages sent out (<code>mqtt.subscribe("/wassim/#")</code>).</p>	"

I believe I've verified the path to the json file is correct with echo $(pwd)/file.json. </p>		<p>The AWS json code is below</p>		<pre><code>{	"Version": "2012-10-17", 	"Statement": [{	    "Effect": "Allow",	    "Action": ["iot:*"],	    "Resource": ["*"]	}]	}	</code></pre>		<p>I've tried numerous changes (spacing, additional lines in between [ &amp; {, etc..) but still can't create the policy. Tried vi &amp; nano as well. Has anyone seen this error before? Thanks </p>	"

I copied the code directly from the AWS site &amp; pasted it (with right-click) into PuTTY so I don't think the editors (vi or nano) changed the code. For anyone else who comes across this error the command that worked for me: aws iot create-policy --policy-name "MyPolicyName" --policy-document file:///home/pi/my_policy_file. Good luck &amp; thanks to @RobbieAverill &amp; @Michael-sqlbot for giving this a look.</p>	"

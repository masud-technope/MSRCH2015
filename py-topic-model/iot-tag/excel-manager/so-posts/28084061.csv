Data mostly consists of different readings from sensor nodes. For the same I followed some books and covered tutorial at <a href="https://jena.apache.org/getting_started/index.html" rel="nofollow">https://jena.apache.org/getting_started/index.html</a>. Tutorials and lessons followed mostly pertain to RDF, SPARQL and Ontologies usage. But still I am not getting how to annotate sensor data. Can anybody give me some pointer or give link to some practical source so that I can do the same.</p>	"

You might have better luck at answers.semanticweb.com where ontology requests are handled a bit better.  Even so, it really comes down to two options: (i) you either find an existing vocabulary that works for the domain and adopt it; or (ii) you create a new vocabulary (possibly importing others).  Then, a reading comes in and you use the vocabulary to describe it."

I know about the existing library for e.g., SSN but the real problem I am facing is how to use it with sensor data. In other words, how do I store the data in annotated form in some data store. Once I can store the annotated data  then only I can use SPARQL to query it."

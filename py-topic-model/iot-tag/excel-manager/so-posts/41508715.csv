I have the app working, but can't figure out how to send the raw commands over USB without the <code>winspool.Drv</code> from the <code>RawPrinterHelper</code> class.</p>		<p>I have also tried sending over Bluetooth as described here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34510095/windows-iot-zebra-bluetooth-printer">Windows IoT - Zebra Bluetooth Printer</a>	 but can't seem to open a connection to my paired device as <code>var devices = await DeviceInformation.FindAllAsync(RfcommDeviceService.GetDeviceSelector(RfcommServiceId.SerialPort));</code> doesn't return any devices. Here is my code:</p>		<pre><code>    private async void PrintAsync()	    {	        textBox.Text = "Searching for devices";		        var devices = await DeviceInformation.FindAllAsync(RfcommDeviceService.GetDeviceSelector(RfcommServiceId.SerialPort));		        if(devices.Count() == 0)	        {	            textBox.Text = "No devices found";	            return;	        }		        textBox.Text = "Number of paired devices found: " + devices.Count();		        var service = await RfcommDeviceService.FromIdAsync("DepotPrinter");	        var socket = new StreamSocket();	        await socket.ConnectAsync(service.ConnectionHostName, service.ConnectionServiceName);		        var writer = new DataWriter(socket.OutputStream);	        var command = "^XA"	        + "^FO20,175^A0N,40,25^FD" + "Yo." + "^FS"	        + "^FO20,250^A0N,40,25^FD" + "IT WORKED!" + "^FS"	        + "^XZ";	        writer.WriteString(command);	        await writer.StoreAsync();	    }	</code></pre>		<p>I would be willing to run my app on mono and Raspbian if it can work.</p>		<p>Any help or direction would be appreciated!</p>		<p>Thanks in advance!</p>		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I am using the on-board bluetooth of the RP3 and not a dongle.</p>	"

I have ordered a serial card for the printer and will try sending the commands via the RPi3's serial port. I will update this post if I can get it to work."

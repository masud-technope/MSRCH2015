I do not see anything arriving on IoT Foundation, it looks like I am hitting the 4KB payload limit (<a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/messaging/payload.html" rel="nofollow">IoT Foundation doc</a>). The shortest byte array I am able to send is only 1349 bytes. Is this a limitation of current IoT Foundation implementation?</p>	"

If you attempt to send a message with a payload greater than this, the connection will simply be terminated.</p>		<p>If you are sending JSON, don't forget that the JSON syntax is included (including pretty printing) in the payload size.  With a pure binary payload you will be able to send a payload of exactly 4096, but you will have to calculate the size in bytes of any string (after encoding) that you send.</p>		<p>Please can you double check how large the payload is and confirm it really is less than 4096 bytes ?</p>		<p>thanks</p>		<p>Paul</p>	"

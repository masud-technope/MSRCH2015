I've checked and the storage.db and storage.db-journal both have read write permissions. I see that it's been suggested to set the flags for the database, QLiteOpenFlags.ReadWrite | SQLiteOpenFlags.Create | SQLiteOpenFlags.FullMutex, but I don't see how to do that?"

If it is true you can reference ["Help Center > Answering"](https://stackoverflow.com/help/accepted-answer) so we can complete this issue. And I see you have post a [new question of the issue about CreateTable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54348519/how-to-add-tags-to-sqlite-connection) so we will continue there."

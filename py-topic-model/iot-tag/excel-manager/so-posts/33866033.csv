When retrieving the data with the Channels api I can set the start parameter. If I set it to yesterday I will get everything after that (as long as the value count is below 8000, which is the maximum amount that can be retrieved in one request). If I set it to two months ago (after which about 20000 values have been logged) I will get the most recent 8000 values.</p>		<pre><code>STARTTIMExxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXXENDTIME	STARTTIMEXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxENDTIME	</code></pre>		<p>So now when I set start date (end date is implicitly set to now) I get the big X from the first row as in the example above when I want the values on the second row.</p>		<p>How would I get 8000 values from the moment I specify?</p>		<p>Is there any other way or do I actually need to set both start and end date and put an interval that is smaller than the time I can log 8000 values and then make more queries to the api to fill up my requested values?</p>	"

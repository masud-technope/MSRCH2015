When I make the request, if the server node has too many resources or too many resource's attributes, the server reply is <code>NULL</code>.	Otherwise, it replies with a Core Link Format that contains the list of available resources stored on it.</p>		<p>Thank you all!	If you want some code, I'll post it. </p>		<p>Client CODE</p>		<pre><code>Request rq = new Request(Code.GET);		            CoapResponse coapRe = coapClientCore.advanced(rq);	            if(coapRe != null)	                System.out.println(coapRe.getResponseText());	            else 	                System.out.println("is null");	</code></pre>	"

For the next travelers, here's what I did:</p>		<ul>	<li>Download all the tools and build parse SDK on your Edison</li>	<li>Put an SD card in the reader and copy libparse.0.0.0 (or whatever is the latest version) to the SD card (/media/sdcard).  You'll find it in /usr/lib</li>	<li>Execute the shutdown command</li>	<li>Wait for Linux to shutdown (see serial terminal)</li>	<li>Put SD card in Mac</li>	<li>Copy libparse.o.0.0.0 to wherever youâ€™ve installed the iotdk-ide-mac from Intel.  Mine was in a "dev" directory under my Mac user.		<ul>	<li>/Users/xxx/dev/iotdk-ide-mac/devkit-x86/sysroots/i586-poky-linux/lib</li>	</ul></li>	<li>Make a copy and rename it libparse.o</li>	<li>In Eclipse, add â€œparseâ€? (w/o quotes) as a library under project properties, linker setttings</li>	<li>Download the parse embedded SDK and expand it.</li>	<li>Copy parse.h from the include directory in the embedded sdks and put it in /Users/xxx/dev/iotdk-ide-mac/devkit-x86/sysroots/i586-poky-linux/usr/include</li>	</ul>	"

It provides a horizontal M2M service platform for developing services independently of the underlying network, with the aim to facilitate the deployment of vertical applications and heterogeneous devices."</p>		<p>my questions: 1) Is om2m (open source project) based on oneM2M standard ? 2) Is there any project developing/ed based on oneM2M standard ?</p>		<p>Thank you.</p>	"

But ETSI is one the founder of OneM2M initiative. So you will find a lot of ideas and principle of smartM2M inside OneM2M.	We estimate at LAAS-CNRS that the overlap is around 70 to 80%. So OM2M is not far away from OneM2M standard. The first official version of OneM2M standard will be publisher in january 2015.	We will do a first demonstration of OM2M with OneM2M partial implementation in december 2014 with other partners at the launch event of OneM2M. </p>		<p>Thierry Monteil	co-founder of OM2M	LAAS-CNRS</p>	"

I also use OM2M as horizontal service platform. Right now I am looking for some documentation about the General concept for OM2M fit to OneM2M ETSI standard. Could you recommend me some documentations about this? Thank you so much"

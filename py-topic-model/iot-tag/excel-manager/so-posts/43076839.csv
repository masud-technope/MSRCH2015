Partitions are used internally to allow scaling of the IoT (Event Hub) and allow for scaling out the consumer app (the one that reads the events out of the Hub).</p>		<p>While you can specify a Partition Key when using Event Hub, this does identify a Partition ID. And using IoT Hub, the option to specify Partition Key is anyway hidden and you cannot influence it. Specifying a Partition Key for a message in <strong>Event Hub</strong> will just make sure that all messages with the same partition key will fall into the same partition. But you cannot tell which partition (0,1,2..n). I have seen projects which try to literary abuse the Partitions and use them as "tenants". Very wrong way of completely abusing scalability of Event Hubs.</p>		<p>Please do not abuse the partitioning of Event Hub (which is anyway the back-end system for an IoT Hub). Do not force Partition Keys. Thus you are unbalancing the Event Hub and may go into a wrong direction. Instead please clearly define a technical issue you are trying to solve and we may be able to help you.</p>	"

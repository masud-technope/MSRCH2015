I am limited to around 3-5 strings at a time, which is frustrating because I am losing 195-197 of the 200 items I am trying to send to the IOT platform.</p>		<p>How can I keep a persistent connection and make sure my entire payload makes it through to the IOT service?</p>	"

You can confirm this by looking at the device connection logs in the device drilldown panel: you'll see evidence of log messages such as "The client ID was reused."</p>		<p>Ben</p>	"

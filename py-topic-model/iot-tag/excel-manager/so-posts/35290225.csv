This application posts messages as a device :</p>		<p><code>	    const IotfApp = require("ibmiotf").IotfApplication;	    const appClient = new IotfApp(configApp);	    /* ... Stuff */	    appClient.publishDeviceEvent(deviceType, deviceId, "metrics", "json", msg);	</code></p>		<p>So far, so good.</p>		<p>I have declared two (out of tens) devices for test purpose in the IoTF.</p>		<p>On the other end, I use a NodeRed IoTF boilerplate sample. Everything seems to work, BUT i receive messages from device that HAS NOT been declared in the IoTF.</p>		<p>Is this a normal behaviour ?	How can I list (nothing found using API) all the terminals sending messages but not 'officially' declared ?</p>		<p>Thanks.</p>		<p>--- Edit ---</p>		<p>Screenshots :</p>		<p>Iot Foundation : <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H4ut77b.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/H4ut77b.png</a></p>		<p>NodeRed boilerplate : <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OAxQKuk.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/OAxQKuk.png</a>        </p>	"

However, when it tries to reconnect the registration will be checked at that point and it will no longer be able to send data to that org.   </p>	"

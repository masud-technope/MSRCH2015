This increase in number of transistors in an IC is way more than the productive design need. The situation raised due this problem is a well-known design productivity gap.Will  IoT and Mobile devices significantly decrease this design productivity gap?</p>	"

One of the commonly-adopted solution to limit the DPG is to raise the level of abstraction in the design process to lower the gap between higher abstraction level and low-level implementations.</p>		<p>Also, the manufacturing process has evolved, look today at how the same manufacturing lines that were used to produce embedded devices are now themselves benefiting from the rise of the Internet of things to improve their productivity through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Industry 4.0</a>.</p>		<p>You take the number of transistors as an example of a limiting factor in terms of productivity, but I don't think this is the main one for consumer electronic devices. The design of the board, the mold for the manufacture, the use of especially expensive materials can be much more limiting factors, and there is even a risk in some cases that the manufacturer will go out of business if its manufacturing process and supply chain are not ready.</p>		<p>In the mobile world we need horse power to enable new use-cases and improve user-experience, whereas in the IoT the situation is somewhat different, as we have different types of devices, thus having different requirements. A simple light bulb will likely require less horse power, and be better at power saving than a home automation gateway would be. In this context, the number of transistor is not as relevant as the fineness of engraving, energy dissipation, <a href="https://e2e.ti.com/blogs_/b/powerhouse/archive/2015/01/29/iot-s-impact-on-global-power-consumption-comes-down-to-standby" rel="nofollow noreferrer">power consumption</a>, <a href="https://www.microchip.com/pressreleasepage/microchip-releases-industry-first-security-solution-amazon-web-services-cloud" rel="nofollow noreferrer">security features</a>, and memory cost-optimizations.</p>	"

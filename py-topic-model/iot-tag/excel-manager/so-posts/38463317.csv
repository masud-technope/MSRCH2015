I pointed a camera to the place where my jalapeños grow and using a simple motion detection software on my computer on the balcony I know when squirrels show up.</p>		<p>I figured out how to establish a Bluetooth Low Energy communication between my computer and my iPhone (my computer is the central and the smartphone is a peripheral).</p>		<p>Is there a way how to invoke a push notificaiton using Bluetooth Low Energy that shows up on my phone whenever my camera detects a squirrel? I want to know if it is possible without an Internet connection.</p>	"

However, do you specifically want APNS, or do you just want a way to wake up your app and display a message to the user when you receive a BLE message from your computer? </p>		<p>I believe you can set up your iPhone app to get BLE notices from the background. If you can do that then you can code your app to trigger a LOCAL notification (different from a push notification, but similar in terms of the UX)</p>	"

Now he wants to send BLE-based notifications to his phone when the camera detects motion. The Arduino would make a good interface for the camera, but he'd still need a way to notify his phone when the camera detected a squirrel."

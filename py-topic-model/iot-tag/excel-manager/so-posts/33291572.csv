When I mined into the app to see what the problem could be, I got the following pop-up:</p>		<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/h5yOq.png" rel="nofollow">App staging failed in the buildpack compile phase</a></p>		<p>I haven't made any changes to my NodeRED flows in months, and if I spin up a new IOT Foundation app, it starts just fine.</p>		<p>Any ideas on what is going on here?</p>	"

New instances of the boilerplate already have this entry removed - hence why they work.</p>	"

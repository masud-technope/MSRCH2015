I understand till Alexa made a call to the lambda function then it make an api call to the smart device server but what I don't understand how does the device know that it has to it has to turn itself off or change the color of the light etc. Do we have to write special programming for that?	Please, someone, explain how does it works as I am new here I am unable to understand it.	Thank you in advance.</p>	"

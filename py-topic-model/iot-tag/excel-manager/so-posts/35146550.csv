(Take for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRaWAN" rel="nofollow">LoraWan</a> which would be extremely suitable to roll out in developing countries).</p>		<p>So, being in a developing country or not, you are stuck with networks and devices that have to deal with low bandwidth anyway. This means that the developers creating the software for your devices need to think very well about how they solve certain type of problems.</p>		<p>A lot of devices currently also have to deal with situations where there is no connectivity at all. For example a tracking device in a container on a ship.	This device should be built in a way, that it will function without a proper internet connection.</p>		<p>Conclusion:</p>		<ul>	<li>IoT devices can work with low bandwidth connections.</li>	<li>Development should be done with the idea of non-connectivity in mind.</li>	</ul>	"

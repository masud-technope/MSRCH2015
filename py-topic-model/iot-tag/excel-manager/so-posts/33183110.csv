It appears that this process occasionally dies or stops broadcasting, particularly if the device has not been rebooted in several days. It can be restarted with the PowerShell command (e.g. in a remote interactive session):</p>		<pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"><code>Start-Process ebootpinger.exe	</code></pre>	"

Someone suggested using another wireless network so I switched to a wireless network from a phone and it worked.  However, I couldn't explain why it would not work on the MS network but @perterdn answer shed a light on that...UDP being blocked could explain the problem."

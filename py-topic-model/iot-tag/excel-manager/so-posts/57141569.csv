As soon as the file gets uploaded by Azure IoT device, to Azure Blob, through IoT Hub it generates a file upload nofication which we can capture through FileUploadNotificationReceiver class (class of Azure IoT SDK) and we can process this event in our application.</p>		<p>Some points here:</p>		<ul>	<li><p>Initially, I tried and tested the file upload notification process with the help of stand-alone Java application as per the Azure IoT documentation and able to receive and process the notification in this sample application.</p></li>	<li><p>However, when I integrate this code with Spring boot I am getting an error message as <strong>"Service threw something mysteriously dangerous, message abandoned."</strong></p></li>	</ul>		<p>Version details -</p>		<ul>	<li>Spring Boot V - 2.1.6.RELEASE</li>	<li>GSON V 2.8.5</li>	</ul>		<p><br>Azure IoT Service client - </p>		<ul>	<li>Group ID - com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot    </li>	<li>Artifact ID - iot-service-client    V - 1.17.1</li>	</ul>		<p>I noticed that this exception message occurs when the FileUploadNotificationReceiver class tries to parse the input JSON received from IoT Hub. The iot-service-client is dependent on GSON dependency. Also, my spring boot application uses GSON dependency. The GSON dependency version is 2.8.5</p>		<p>Any help regarding solve this issue will be appreciated.</p>		<p>Thanks in advance.</p>		<p>Avinash Deshmukh</p>	"

On the source side, where the file upload API at the Azure IoT device side is used, the blob name was not used correctly. I was using the complete file path as blob name and it was containing the \ (back slash) entry.</p>		<p>You need to change the blob name which will be different from the source file name and it should not have any .</p>	"

No VCC connection on the USB-Serial converter side (but they share a common GND connection). Changing the Baud-Rate makes no difference. I tried screen, minicom and Arduino's Serial Monitor. I can send "AT" but the response is empty. The monitor's window is full of rubbish when i grab the MAC address over esptool.</p>		<p>I'm pretty much out of ideas at the moment! What else can I try?</p>	"

Seems to me, it doesn't include everything (at least no AT commands or i need to flash it with another firmware first). So I flashed the latest non SDK espressif Firmware under Windows. Chip boots up fine and i get 'Ready' in the console. Next thing is to figure out how to send and receive AT commands."

For it to *run* the firmware, you must not connect GPIO0 to GND, as this will cause the ESP to boot into "download new firmware" mode. Leave GPIO0 floating and do a power cycle."

(My application has several dependencies, not all of which are signed, so to sign it would mean going through the ILMerge mill or similar which I would rather avoid if I can.)</p>		<p>I don't expect people to be able to tell me why my app doesn't run (although that would be nice!) but I am looking for ways of diagnosing this.  Looking in event logs, etc, is yielding no information whatsoever.  My app keeps its own event log, which is not showing any evidence of the app starting.</p>		<p>Thanks in advance</p>	"

A quick google does not reveal the meaning of this error code though..."

Turning off notifications via the control panel is NOT sufficient, as UAC is still running in the background - it just doesn't notify you!  To completely turn off UAC, edit registry entry:	HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System and set the DWORD value EnableLUA to 0 </p>		<p>Evidence of UAC behaviour can be found in the windows event log at:	Applications And Services Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows ->UAC</p>	"

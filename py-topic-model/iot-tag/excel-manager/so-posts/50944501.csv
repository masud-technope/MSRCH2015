The message protocol it uses is MQTT. It is connected to Mosquitto via Wi-Fi and successfully sends data to it (i am able to see it using <code>mosquitto_sub -v -t "#"</code>. However, I would like to be able to send this data to Orion Context Broker and then receive it using REST commands and store it using Fiware-Cygnus afterwards. </p>		<p>the topic that sensor publishes messages to is <code>tt/sergo/demo/sw</code> </p>		<p>the name of the sensor presented in mosquitto_sub when sensor is first connected: DMS-A01</p>		<p>the IP - address of sensor: 192.168.0.108</p>		<p>I have installed Iot-Agent UL, which is working, but I don't know how to make it listen to the specific sensor that sends data to Mosquitto.	I read the manuals but either missed something or did not find the solution to my problem.	I tried using the manual below, but could not apply it to my problem.</p>		<p><a href="http://secmotic.com/blog/connect-thing-mqtt-ultralight-fiware/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Connecting "thing" to Fiware</a></p>		<p>Thank you in advance, stack overflow community.</p>	"

That provision operation "creates" the device in the IOTA-UL and map it with the corresponding entity at CB. Then, you can start sending  measures using MQTT.</p>		<p>You can have a look to <a href="http://fiware-iot-stack.readthedocs.io/en/master/device_api/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this piece of documentation</a> for more detail.</p>	"

Also, in my case, is `/tt` an API key (and if yes, then do i need to change in in config.js file afterwards)? or since it is not mentioned, it remains default?"

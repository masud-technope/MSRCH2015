And those data will be gathered from android app and the app is supposed to be as a control. But I don't know how to send control data through ThingSpeak so that I can drive actuators at the Rapberry Pi . How can I achieve this ? Can you suggest me if there is alternative solution rather than ThingSpeak?</p>	"

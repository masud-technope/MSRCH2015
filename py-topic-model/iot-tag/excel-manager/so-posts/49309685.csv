What I have found on the web everywhere is this:	Edit the AppManifest. Add 	  ...IgnorableNamespaces="uap mp iot">	(- which already was there when I looked into it)	Then add:</p>		<p>   </p>		<pre><code>&lt;iot:Capability Name="systemManagement"/&gt;	</code></pre>		<p></p>		<p>But: "iot:Capability" stays undercurled, saying, that it "has invalid child element 'Capabilities' in namespace 'http:... appX/manifest/iot/win10'</p>		<p>I had already 2 other capabilites selected</p>		<pre><code>&lt;Capability Name="internetClient" /&gt;	&lt;Capability Name="privateNetworkClientServer" /&gt;	</code></pre>		<p>Can they interfere?	I could not find this error somewhere else on the whole web. Would be great if someone had an explanation for this. Thanks in advance!</p>	"

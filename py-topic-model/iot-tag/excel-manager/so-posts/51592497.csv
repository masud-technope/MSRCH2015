This error is most likely due to an unknown or inactive certificate.".</p>		<p>If I attach the button to my Lambda function as a trigger, when it doesn't exist as a thing in IoT core, the button works as expected and doesn't give me an error.</p>		<p>I have compared the certificate created when adding as a trigger in Lambda to my certificate created from CSR. There are almost no differences with the exception of the DN config attached to the CSR.</p>		<p>Any help would be appreciated in understanding why my CSR created certificate gives an error.</p>	"

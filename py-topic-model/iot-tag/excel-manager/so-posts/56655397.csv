I want to do a post request but can't get a connection to the host:</p>		<pre><code>const char *host = "firestore.googleapis.com";	int r=0; //retry counter	while((!httpsClient.connect(host, httpsPort)) &amp;&amp; (r &lt; 30)){	  delay(50);	  Serial.print(".");	  r++;	}   		 httpsClient.print(String("POST ") + "/v1beta1/projects/myproject/databases/(default)/documents/loggings" + " HTTP/1.1\r\n" +	               "Host: " + "firestore.googleapis.com" + "\r\n" +	               "Content-Type: application/json"+ "\r\n" +	               "Content-Length: 240" + "\r\n\r\n" +               	               postData+ "\r\n" +	               "Connection: close\r\n\r\n");	</code></pre>		<p>The connect() function doesn't work because the host can't be found (404). How do I need to use the connect function to get a proper connection to the firestore host?</p>	"

It's not secure but maybe that's ok for your use case. httpsPort should be 443. For me connecting to fcm.googleapis.com works if done like this:</p>		<pre><code>WiFiClientSecure client;	client.setInsecure(); // INSECURE!	client.connect("fcm.googleapis.com", 443);	</code></pre>	"

With external power supply the module works ok. When the module received something the noise dropped to 300-400 Hz.</p>		<p>I found a visual solution and rather simple way from youtube to really see the noise on the data pin. </p>		<p><strong>THE LED.</strong></p>		<p>When i connected green LED with a 100 Ohm resistor to the data pin the led is constantly glowing. Its not bright but you see small green light. On this occasion the receiver did not receive nothing. So is was pure constant noise.</p>		<p>Next step was to start messing with <strong>Low pass filter</strong>. I connected 240Ohm resistor and 1.5 uF cap as low pass between data pin and ground. So i connected the greed LED to filtered voltage and the constant noise were filtered. </p>		<p>Led is blinking by the data signals only when the transmitter sends something to the receiver.</p>		<p>Also, my <strong>baudrate</strong> in the transmitter and receiver code was a bit high. I moved from 1000 bits/s down to 200 bits/s.</p>		<p>From now, the raspberry can detect data from this module and everything is a lot better.</p>	"

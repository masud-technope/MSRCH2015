I need to do this because I need to process only the first 1000 messages in the queue online. What is the best approach here?</p>	"

The promotion is the first 1000 customers who sign up for a specific program get $100 credit for shopping.  This credit MUST be online and available once the customer sign up for the promotion.  Now the question is how do you make sure the order of your messages in the queue (any queue - can be kafka, SQS, etc.) to make sure that you are processing the first 1000 customers only in the right order?"

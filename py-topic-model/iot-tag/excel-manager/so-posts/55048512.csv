The Problem is that the Win Xp is not able to use SHA2 and https but the sever doesn't allow insecure traffic. </p>		<p>I want to use the IOT2040 as a middle man forwarding http request as https request to the sever.</p>		<p>But I got following problem:	The reverse Proxy just allows my to forward one website to the other but I need two. </p>		<pre><code> &lt;VirtualHost *:8082&gt;	                ServerName TargetServer.com/	                SSLProxyEngine On RequestHeader set Front-End-Https "On"	                ProxyPass / http://TargetServer.com/	                ProxyPassReverse / http://TargetServer.com/	          &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;	</code></pre>		<p>I would like to be able to go on XXX.TargetServer.com as well. Is there any way to forward any http request to the IOT? </p>		<p>Thanks a lot.</p>	"

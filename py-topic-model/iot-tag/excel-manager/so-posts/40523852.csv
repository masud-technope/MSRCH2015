The output is a simple console log. However, I am unable to load the event hub compatible end point of the IoT Hub as the trigger (the only option available is to create a new Event Hub). How do I proceed? The code for the device to send to Azure' IoT Hub is working and I am able to view the messages via the Device Explorer tool.</p>	"

But you need to change it to match the service bus connection string format -	"Endpoint=[your iot hub compatible end point];SharedAccessKeyName=[your key name];SharedAccessKey=[your key];EntityPath=[your event hub compatible name]"</p>		<p>key name and key can be taken from the "Shared access policy" section.</p>		<p>Good Luck </p>	"

This time I get the following error message:	"Management operation failed. status-code: 401, status-description: InvalidSignature: The token has an invalid signature..."	When you refer to the service bus connection format, do you mean the textbox that asks for the connection string? And can the connection name be anything or should it be the IoT Hub's event hub compatible name? @shachar"

Angular for example has little to do with anything. </p>		<p>On the web front end you need to implement a javascript library like Paho.js that will use the MQTT protocol to connect to a broker and start aggregating messages from connected devices. </p>		<p>Express has little to do as well as you are not exposing a Restful interface but connecting low level through a broker. A good solution in Node.js is Mosca. </p>		<p>Mongo is good for dumping data from devices. </p>		<p>I have written a <a href="http://karmadust.com/internet-of-things-with-ios-node-js-and-mqtt/" rel="nofollow">tutorial using Node.js and iOS</a> so have a look and you might find it interesting.</p>	"

IoT pronounced as Internet of things. iot is recently used for connected electronics devices .basically it is a form of running your program inside the electronic chip and mostly trying to connect the devices.making control on devices using the programmed chip. there are separate IDE's are avaialble for developing and testing the programme on embeded chip.	you can use angularjs as a frontend(making your GUI) for your IoT'S application.</p>	"

Typically the sensors are low cost sensors and are constantly transmitting small amounts of data in MQTT or TCP protocols. With Node.js you can write, servers for such applications very easily. </p>		<p>Mongo is useful if you have unstructured data, which could happen if you work with multiple sensors. If you don't need unstructured data structures, SQL is sufficient. </p>		<p>All the data that you get from devices, finally needs to be consumed via applications. Express and Angular are great platforms to manage web applications. </p>		<p>You can read a little more about IoT platforms in MEAN at <a href="http://blog.yatis.io/scalable-iot-platform-mean-stack/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.yatis.io/scalable-iot-platform-mean-stack/</a></p>	"

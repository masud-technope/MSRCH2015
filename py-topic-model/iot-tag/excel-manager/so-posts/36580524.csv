I'm almost certain this question may not be appropriate here, but there doesn't seem to be a specific place on SO for such questions, so I've decided that as a last ditch effort, I'll ask on the main site. Please don't be (too) angry with me....</p>		<p>I'm looking for a specific IoT project, that was  developing modules connected by BLE. They were independent modules, say just a speaker, on a coin-sized die connected to each other or a computer via BLE. The project seems to have been succesfully funded on Kickstarter, with an SDK and shipping to the backers, but I can't find them again. I've been searching for a day and a half, but I can't remember for the life of me what they're called. I've searched through my chrome bookmarks, but the computer I was using at the time was a lab system, so I most likely wasn't logged into Google, and those systems are wiped every week. The project was probably from 2014, and they kinda advertised themselves as an easy way to learn HW/SW, and the SDK might have had Code block drag and drop, like Scratch. No combination of search terms that I can think of on Google is bringing up the results I want. Please help, if you know this project, or a specific way to find it.</p>		<p>I'm fairly certain this question will get moved, but before it does, I hope SO's vast and vastly informed community will be able to help me or point me in the right direction....</p>	"

Asking for off site tools, programs, tutorials, etc are off topic for stackoverflow."

It doesn't ask for comparisons, only help in identifying the product and/or a way to locate it's internet presence. I was hoping this placed it under the ambit of SO, since SO is about programming. If the question is improper, I won't object to it being removed, provided that I find a way to answer my question..."

Instead, describe the problem and what has been done so far to solve it. I do hope you find what you are looking for but I don't think it will be here."

But then at least someone may answer me this, as to how to find said resource, because I am at my wit's end, and Google is frankly not helping... That comes under assistance with software because I have tried to solve my problem and described the information set I have to go with it... I hope?"

If anyone wants to know, it's probably one of the cheaper options for creating a limited use remote application.</p>	"

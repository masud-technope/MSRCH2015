I need some functionality to give presence of the device. How can I make it possible for nodeMCU to show it's presence? 	I got to know about PubNub and it's services, but it seems to work only for webpages, not for hardware devices pinging back to webpage.</p>		<p>Please consider, I am a noob into this. Any help will be appreciated.</p>	"

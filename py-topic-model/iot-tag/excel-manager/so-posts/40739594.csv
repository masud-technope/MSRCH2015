I read FAQ <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/faqs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://aws.amazon.com/iot/faqs/</a> and doc but now found anything related to routing data to API on EC2 instance. This developer guide <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-create-rule.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-create-rule.html</a> shows how to route data to dynamoDb, S2, Kinesis, SNS and machine learning. Is it possible to route data to EC2 instance from IoT Rules Engine?</p>	"

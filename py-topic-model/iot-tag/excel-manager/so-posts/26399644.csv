If the device have IP address, how can implement connection between device and PHP application? How can collect data from device to PHP application?</p>	"

It does not matter in which language this software will be written. The only important thing is the fact  this software will communicate with PHP-based webservice to exchange data.</p>		<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/464qK.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>	"

The requirement- I have PHP web application for collecting user medical data. Many devices connected with the application (Blood pressure checking, Thermometer etc). If these devices have IP address, how it can connect to web app and collect user data?"
26399644,41452385,26399697,3,0,Thu Oct 16 09:51:00 EDT 2014,1521186,"You need to determine which OS do each device have. Then you need to write software for devices, depending on their OS. Or, maybe devices already have some software pre-install and you just need to configure where will they send data."

26399644,42778987,26399697,3,0,Wed Nov 26 03:18:00 EST 2014,null,"This isn't even remotely correct. You can't run an app on a blood pressure monitor or a medical weighing scale. It is possible to gather data with PHP but the exact method will depend on the interface offered by each device. This is most definitely not the way."

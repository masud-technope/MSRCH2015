I need to run some operations for each item in that List. Each item may have different running time (i.e. 3min, 5min)</p>		<p>Later from my Azure Web App user will be able to add some item to that List. I might update WebJob Dictionary/List using Azure Queue. </p>		<p>Any idea about how can i run individual process/timer task for each list item?</p>	"

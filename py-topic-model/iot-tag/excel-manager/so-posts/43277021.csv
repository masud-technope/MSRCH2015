43277021,73629068,43277021,3,2,Fri Apr 07 14:22:00 EDT 2017,3407841,"No it isn't.  If you are trying to hook these to networks that are not under your control, you have other options.  mDNS (multicast DNS) should work even though your router doesn't see the correct name.  If your devices require Internet access anyway, then you could also use a web service.  You could create your own UDP broadcast/multicast."

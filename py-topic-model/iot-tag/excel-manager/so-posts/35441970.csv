Here is an example of such a chart:	<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NGEfE.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NGEfE.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>What configuration do we have over the visualization?  For example:</p>		<ul>	<li>Can I control the boldness or visibility of division lines?</li>	<li>Can I place labels on the X-Axis?</li>	<li>Can I move the labels on the Y-Axis to the left of the chart?</li>	<li>Can we plot marker points on the graph showing data points?</li>	<li>Can we control the nature of the curve (it appears like some kind of best fit curve by default)?</li>	</ul>	"

The other graph attributes mentioned above are not customizable at the moment.</p>	"

The data is collected through an IoT platform and stored to a Cassandra Cluster. For the data distribution to all other applications from Cassandra Cluster, I have created a Rest Api in java.</p>		<p>The data collection scripts are written in C and python . While the Rest Api in java.</p>		<p>My question is the following.</p>		<p>I want to filter my raw sensor data in order to exclude values such as high &amp; low temperatures etc. in order to have as low as possible fault ratio.  have read about the t Kalman Filtering , but I don't want it to happen in real time , I prefer to filter my data straight on the Cassandra nodes. </p>		<p>My best guess right now is to create a service using for ex. java , and filtering data with a time gap excluding the undesirable values.</p>		<p>For example a service that will triggered once a day and it will exclude all the "bad" values from the time of last activation since the last record.</p>		<p>Is there any suggestion for an approach like that?	Or does anyone have a better suggestion ?	Or even better some publication that can guide me through the process .</p>		<p>Thanks in advance.</p>	"

If you don't want to use Spark, you'll need to be very careful when implementing the service - don't perform something like <code>select * from table</code>, etc., as it will kill cluster.</p>		<p>P.S. I can expand answer if you provide an additional information:</p>		<ul>	<li>Schema for tables with infomation</li>	<li>What operations you'll perform inside that service.</li>	</ul>	"

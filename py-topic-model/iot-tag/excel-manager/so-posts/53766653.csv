I can´t use any client libraries available in the internet. I would like to ask where can I find examples that works similar to this as an inspiration for my work, or any suggestions regarding the steps I should follow is highly appreciated.</p>		<p>Thank you!</p>	"

In which case the only document you should be reading is the MQTT spec."

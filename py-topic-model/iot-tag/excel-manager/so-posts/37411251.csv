I have followed the document in this link for creating the device simulator.	<a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/nodereddevice_sample.html#devices" rel="nofollow">https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/nodereddevice_sample.html#devices</a></p>		<p>It can connect and send the MQTT message event to IoT platform but when I try to get the historical data from REST API, it always returns empty.	<a href="https://os9c6l.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/api/v0002/historian" rel="nofollow">https://os9c6l.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/api/v0002/historian</a></p>		<p>Not sure what when wrong.</p>	"

Do you get the same 401?"

They told me that they are going to have a option to use CloudantDB for keeping the historical data. So it should be fine for me then. Thank you very much Barny."

37411251,62453312,37476178,3,0,Fri May 27 07:58:00 EDT 2016,2318649,"I spoke to IBM support, then I tried a different app from Poster, I used RESTClient, and got a 200 response, and an empty JSON object for data. Then I was told that Historian only records data for devices added after it is turned on, so to delete the device and re-add it. Also there was apparently a problem yesterday with historian. Anyway, now it works, I have some historical data which was provided by the temp sensor on my Pi. Key thing is as idan says if your device already existed before turning Historian on, delete the device and re-add it."

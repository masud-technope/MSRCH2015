I'm assuming the `msg` parameter being passed to the function is the json payload from the message received from the `mqtt_notify_topic` specified when you started the Geospatial Analytics service. Also, just to make sure, the `mqtt_notify_topic` must be different from the `mqtt_input_topics`.		Each event message received from the Geospatial Analytics service will contain the eventType field."

My use case is to connect a IoT device to my existing Application. </p>		<p>I am looking at the following communication scenario:</p>		<p>Raspberry Pi &lt;---> Server (which will run the IoT Controller) &lt;---> websocket to my application backend running on the same server &lt;---> Rest API interface between my application backend and frontend to control the Pi</p>		<p>To make the above explicit, Raspberry Pi through the network talks to an IoT controller running in a server. The IoT controller talks to an application backend running on the same server using websocket. The application backend and frontend communicate via REST APIs. From the UI I will control the Pi. </p>		<p>I googled a lot, but find the choices confusing. </p>		<p>It would be much appreciated if I get a pointer an open source or free trial version of a commercial IoT controller solution to experiment and understand. </p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

Faye can be used as a server sent event and is available for different languages. I used it with ruby. My raspberry pi client was also using ruby for this purpose.</p>		<p><a href="https://faye.jcoglan.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://faye.jcoglan.com/</a></p>		<p><a href="https://github.com/faye/faye" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/faye/faye</a></p>		<p>I dont know about the open source software that does this, but with faye you can easily build one.</p>		<p>happy new year :)</p>	"

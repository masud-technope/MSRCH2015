Data is also written to the server. But I can not intercept the record in the server itself to send data to the device. I can not understand what method this is implemented in the library. Callback does not process the record.</p>		<pre><code>    server.subscribe_server_callback(CallbackType.ItemSubscriptionCreated, create_monitored_items)	server.subscribe_server_callback(CallbackType.ItemSubscriptionModified, modify_monitored_items)	server.subscribe_server_callback(CallbackType.ItemSubscriptionDeleted, delete_monitored_items)	</code></pre>	"

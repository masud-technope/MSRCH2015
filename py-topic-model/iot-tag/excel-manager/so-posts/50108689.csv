But I imagine more appropriate the scenario of "Invite User" to control the devices, and when doing it, the app receives a notification for accepting, but...what must happen after this on the underground?, I'm I little confused for "What to search", to start doing this, for example, when I didn't knew what was the concept of refreshing a webpage in real time I got the keyword for "polling", and just with that I was able to do the work, So, I don't know If you could just give a direction of what to search for the feature I'm looking, or at leats example of tecnologies using something close to this.</p>	"

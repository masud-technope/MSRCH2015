I set one of them as a server and connected to internet by using No-IP service. (It's same as a server).</p>		<p>Now, i want to:</p>		<ul>	<li>Control devices </li>	<li>Devices monitoring </li>	<li>Save data.	Controlling will be done by multiple users.<br/><br/>	I am a beginner and want to develop a server to do this it seems hardly with me (protocols,....). <br/> Eclipse IoT has many frameworks but i don't know where to start.<br/> Which framework could i begin with?</li>	</ul>	"

I want to know which framework could help me build back-end server to control many my devices (current only one device if using esp8266 as a server).		Now, i use **firebase DB** to control my devices. No need own back-end server anymore. Thank you."

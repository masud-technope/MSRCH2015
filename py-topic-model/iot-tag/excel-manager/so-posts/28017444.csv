There was a process running in my computer that hits an URL, receive JSON data and if it gets shutdown flag yes, it turn itself off. I can set that flag from my mobile. The lacking was I could not turn on.</p>		<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>		<p>Yes you can, but you have to do a lot of hardware related work. like: Bluetooth Relay Controller. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwLw7Db32TI" rel="nofollow">Here is a video</a>.</p>	"

IRKit is a WiFi enabled Open Source Infrared Remote Controller device.	Home electronics with an infrared remote, like air conditioners, TVs, lights can be controlled using iPhone and iPad via IRKit.</p>		<p>IRKit works with IRKit's official app and you can easily create iOS apps to send IR signals to control home electronics using IRKit iOS-SDK .</p>		<p>You can create apps for example that does:</p>		<pre><code>Use location, turns on air conditioner when you arrive near your home.	Press one button to turn off all your home electronics when you leave home.	Connect with Facebook, and automatically change your TV's channel to which your friend is watching.	</code></pre>		<p>Hope It will help.</p>	"

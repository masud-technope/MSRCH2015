I know espeasy is using http requests and Tasmota is using mqtt.</p>		<p>I want to control my sonoff devices by a raspberry pi that is acting as a home automation hub, and it in turn send updates and receives commands from AWSIoT platform. For interacting with AWSIoT platform, it uses mqtt.</p>		<p>What are the pros and cons of using either? and will it cause problems if I control several sonoff devices with http, while using mqtt for AWSIoT? or better use mqtt for all AWSIoT and sonoff?</p>	"

My initial understanding is we can do with Registry check but, if we don't have registry keys then what is the alternate way to find the type of Windows 10 IOT OS we are trying to run my Application."

For example: `GetProductInfo(10, 0, 0, 0, &type);` the `type` will be 4 on Windows 10 Enterprise and 123 on Windows 10 IoT Core."

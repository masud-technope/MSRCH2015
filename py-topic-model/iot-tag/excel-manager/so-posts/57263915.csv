57263915,101424923,57263915,3,1,Tue Aug 13 11:12:00 EDT 2019,24447,"It looks to me as if the upm Python package is a Python binding for a [whole load of drivers written in C](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm) that in turn depend on something called [MRAA](https://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/) that runs on Linux, so even if you could install the Python package I don't think that'll get you anywhere on any Micropython platform. What platform are you actually using and what devices do you want to talk to?"

I was attempting to comprehend the datasheet to see if I could write my own i2c scripts in micropython but really don't know alot about deciphering which registers/values to write to control it the way I want. Luckily there is a UPM python script that does exactly this, but I might have to resort to a RPi or something of the sort"

For this we need to give a device id to the node. Is it possible to create a flow where the device id is dynamic. Let's say I have 10000 sensors / devices. I want to read the data for each of these sensors in a mulitplexed fashion by changing the device id. 	It is impossible to create 10000 device nodes. So, what is the best way to manage this number of sensors / devices?</p>	"

This can also be used to used with the IBM IoT Out node.  When msg.deviceId is set on a message sent to the Out node, it will <strong>over-ride</strong> what is set in the node itself. 	If it isn't working for you, please add your code.  </p>	"

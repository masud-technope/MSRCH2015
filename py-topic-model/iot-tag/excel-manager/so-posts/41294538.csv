It is expected. It means <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384325(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the server has fulfilled the request, but there is no new information to send back.</a></p>		<p>Second, you want to receive the Device-To-Cloud message you have sent. It is unreachable. Because this GET api is used to receive Cloud-To-Device messages.</p>		<p>In short, Device-To-Cloud and Cloud-To-Device are different messaging primitives that Azure IoT hub provides to communicate with a device. And Device-To-Device communication that you want is not supported natively with Azure IoT Hub.</p>		<p>Finally, how to send Cloud-To-Device message?</p>		<p>For test purpose, you can <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/tree/master/tools/DeviceExplorer#send" rel="nofollow noreferrer">send Cloud-To-Device message from Device Explorer</a>. More detailed information you can reference <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-c2d" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>	"

Using this feature, node-red deploys all its nodes and flows very quickly. </p>		<p>However, I would like to know - where flows and nodes ,we develop in Node-RED editor, are deployed when we click "deploy" button in the node-RED? The reason why I am asking because I would like to deploy Node-RED's generated code ( I guess it is in Node.js) on remote devices (e.g., Android) <strong>automatically</strong>. </p>		<p>I know one of solution to connect is -- run MQTT publisher on Android device and write subscriber in MQTT subscriber in NodeRED to get event data. But, the problem with this solution is - manual deployment (time consuming, error prone).</p>		<p>As Tiago has suggested in the answer section of this question, Node-RED generates <strong>JSON files</strong> in the <code>useDir</code> according to nodes and flows we define in the Node-RED editor. Can we get <code>node.js</code> files, instead of JSON files ? This would help us to deploy device specific code on each device without loading Node-RED editor on each device?</p>	"

(Please feel free to correct me) The way I see the node-RED application is  -- it contains nodes and connections between them. Each node should be deployed individually on each individual device and they talk with each other through some communication protocol (e.g., MQTT). So, I would like to deploy one node, rather than whole application on a single device."

But what I think you're confused about what a node is. are you writing your own nodes or just dragging and dropping from the left side pane? http://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/first-node.html"
33842473,55450760,33842696,3,0,Sat Nov 21 12:12:00 EST 2015,517752,"The way I see Node-RED is (Please feel free to correct me!) - It provides drag-and-drop interface to write `node.js` application. For instance, I have to write 50 lines of code using node.js to  just develop MQTT subsriber. This functionality is possible in Node-RED is just by dragging MQTT input node in the node-RED editor. So, I am looking for a solution that generates Node.js code simply by dragging a small block. If  I could get generated node.js code then, I can write a script that deploy the code on device automatically, rather than loading Node-RED editor on each device."

Its connected with USB.</li>	</ol>		<p>We need to ensure there is no lag as the data needs to be plotted in real time.</p>		<p>To pass data from Edison to Intel Compute Stick we are considering using MQTT but there is an opinion that it may lag due to some internal queue system.</p>		<p>Another option we are looking at is JSON, which could be also cause lagging at 100 readings per second.</p>		<p>Any advise on best protocol to use to communicate the info from Edison boars would be much appreciated, thanks.</p>	"

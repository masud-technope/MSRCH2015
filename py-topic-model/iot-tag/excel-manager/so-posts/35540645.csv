RabbitMQ makes it very easy to communicate between systems, through the internet. As long as each machine / process can access the same RabbitMQ (server / cluster), you should be ok.</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>Is rabbitmq secure enough to do that?</p>	</blockquote>		<p>Yes, as long as you follow standard security practices like any application that you expose to the internet. </p>		<p>Use firewalls, use SSL, set secure usernames and passwords with limited permissions, etc. </p>	"

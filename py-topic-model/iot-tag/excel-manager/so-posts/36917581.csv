I successfully run AndroidPubSub example given in above list. I can connect and subscribe. But message which I am publishing is not updating device shadow I have on AWS. Even when I update shadow on AWS console message not came on android device. I am missing something very small somewhere or am doing completely wrong? </p>	"

While publishing message to topic we should mention complete topic string available in AWS console. i.e. </p>		<pre><code>$aws/things/lamp/shadow/update	</code></pre>		<p>Now adding complete string as topic I am able to publish message to AWS IoT. To receive updates on android device subscribe to /update/accepted. </p>		<pre><code>$aws/things/lamp/shadow/update/accepted	</code></pre>	"

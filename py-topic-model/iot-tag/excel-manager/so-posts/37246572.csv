I want to make sure the approach is perfect to go. Please suggest.</p>	"

I am just wondering, why you want to have a single topic for each device -- it might be better to use different partitions within a topic..."

This will ensure automatically via key-based-hash-partitioning that all data from a single sensor is written into the same partition."

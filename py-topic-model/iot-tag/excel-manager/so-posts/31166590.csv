That being said, one big warning here: TI in general is notorious for publishing completely awful, beginner-mistake-level source code in their application notes. Out of personal experience, I can say that this is _especially_ true for their sub-GHz Chipcon radio. Be wary of any "offical" source code coming from TI."

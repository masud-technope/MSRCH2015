I can't catch the result from a lambda function to use it to evaluate the transition or even the next state. 	And now I am thinking what would be more suitable.	Publish the lambda result in MQTT topic which trigger a iot rule? 	Should I create a "cascade architecture " calling different event models for each lambda?	Any other method?</p>		<p>I am trying a simple program about "access control" and I want to evaluate some conditions in a lambda function. Conditions like, employees list, roles etc... These conditions are evaluated in a lambda function but then I can't pass the result to the event without invoke it again.</p>	"

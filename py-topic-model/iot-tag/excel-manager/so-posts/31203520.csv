Several brokers support clustering (also open source ones like https://verne.mq or https://rabbitmq.com) which tackle the challenge of scalability in a different way. Typically, the subscription and session state is available on all cluster nodes enabling that a MQTT cluster appears to a device as one big server."

You need a system that can move subscriptions between nodes, so that messages and their interested parties can all be connected to the same node, but all users can be distributed over nodes."

Any suggested terminals that will display CR and LF?)</p>		<p>I used the same baud rate and settings but with no luck. I have tried to switch hardware and software flow control and have checked CR and LF to be added.</p>		<p>Any ideas why this would not work?</p>		<p>I have noticed that if I have minicom open and then run the Python script that the output from the ESP8266 gets displayed in minicom indicating and sending issue.(Script fails cause minicom intercepts the incoming messages)</p>	"

The problem was that the ESP8266 needs CR + LF after each AT command to respond.</p>		<p>To do this with Putty you need to press Ctrl+M and Ctrl+J to manually insert the CR+LF. As an alternative, the Arduino IDE - Serial window can be used as it allows you to automatically add CR+LF.(The Arduino IDE also works on most OS's)</p>	"

I was sending simple AT+RST to my esp's and getting and echo back plus "ERROR". All I had to do was turn on append cr-lf in Termite 3.1. Thank you!"

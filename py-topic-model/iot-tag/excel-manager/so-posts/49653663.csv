The data collection service persists all sensor events grouped by sensor id and set id.</p>		<p>Now I want to use ThingsBoard to visualize the data. </p>		<p>Is it possible to create virtual devices in ThingsBoard? Each virtual device should represent a sensor and get the data from the existing persistent storage. And I dont want to get all sensor values for all devices. But I want to select a device and a set and then visualize only these values. The data should not be stored in the embedded Cassandra database. Is it possible to load the selected data only in memory? Everytime I select any data, ThingsBoard should pull the selected data again. Or an extra servcie should push the data again. </p>	"

When you create devices, you can create dashboards that can interact with devices data. You select what devices you want to use.</p>		<p>Unfortunately you need to save the data in the database. You cant show anything in dashboard if is not stored. </p>	"

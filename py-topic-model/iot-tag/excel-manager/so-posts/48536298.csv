How can I do it? 	I know I should use a log appender and I also installed MongoDB Compass. but I don't know how to get real data from them in Java application, and save them into the database and then see the results in whether Java Application or  MongoDB Compass. </p>		<p>I am a little  confused with the usage of this platform. </p>	"

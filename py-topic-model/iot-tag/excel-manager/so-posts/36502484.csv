The application get's an incoming request and returns some data back to me (The client) on another computer of mine.</p>		<p>The issues I'm facing is when I deploy this to my Raspberry Pi 3 running Windows 10 IoT Core (The newest from Insider), I can't access the application from my client computer at all. Is this a thing with the Pi's firewall or something else preventing this?</p>		<p>I CAN access the IoT Core's Web interface on port 8080, but I cannot access my application running on port 80. (I've tried switching the port to another one aswell, works locally on my Windows 10 but not on the Pi)</p>		<p>Does anyone know a solution, or have faced a similar issue?</p>		<p><strong>Note:</strong>	I've also tried examples like (<a href="https://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/samples/BlinkyWebServer.htm">https://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/samples/BlinkyWebServer.htm</a>) which again, works on my Windows 10 pc, and can be accessed by my other PC if their on the same network, but not on my Pi)</p>	"

36502484,60707572,36502484,3,0,Mon Apr 11 15:56:00 EDT 2016,3547124,"Wow, this really seems to ring a bell. Unfortunately, I'm on vacation and don't have access to all my stuff. I'm not using the Windows 10 IoT core but a version of Linux on the Intel Edison. A couple of notes. The IoT core targets industrial IoT, so I'm sure it has integrated security. Try a different client (not your dev platform). Check your router, IoT core and dev computer firewalls. Some industrial stacks have white lists."

I couldn't find how to add a rule to the Firewall but after some help on Freenode C# Chat forum, I found the following snippet:</p>		<p>First I log into the Pi through PowerShell</p>		<pre><code>Enter-PsSession -ComputerName MyRaspberryPi-Credential MyRaspberryPi\Administrator	</code></pre>		<p>Then I manually add the Firewall opening of the port I'm using. In this case port 8080.</p>		<pre><code>netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Raspberry Pi Webserver" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8080	</code></pre>		<p>After that, everything worked as expected. I could access the port on my Raspberry Pi! All good!</p>		<p>Thanks to @canton7 and @taylor-kidd in the comments, for coming with suggestions that in the end helped me!</p>		<p><strong>EDIT 12th of April</strong>:	It seems like this issue with the Firewall not being opened, was actually a known issue by Microsoft already. They write that in their Relase notes for the Insider Preview version 14295 (Which I am using) here <a href="http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/ReleaseNotesInsiderPreview.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/ReleaseNotesInsiderPreview.htm</a></p>	"

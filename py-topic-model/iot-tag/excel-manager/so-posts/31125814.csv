Either raspberry pi, cubieboard, or beagleboneblack? These 3 types are enough to differentiate. 	I was hoping to use <code>cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor</code> but this is not available on ARM ports of debian :-/</p>	"

Besides, consider that the Allwinner A10 on the Cubieboard has Cortex-A8 r3p2, whereas the TI AM3359 on the BeagleBone Black has, er, Cortex-A8 r3p2..."

In the case of the cubie and beagle, it seems that it doesn't fit. Oops :)	Thanks for noticing this!"

I can't find any module for TLS client authentication (they all require nginx for handling that) and I am not sure if there are already stable tools for doing something similar.</p>		<p>My question is, is there any module for using flask with client authentication directly without a web server (nginx + gunicorn, apache + wsgi) or do I need to set it up? Is there any already stable tool/solution for what I am trying to achieve? I guess this is a very typical problem in IoT applications.</p>		<p>Any help would be really appreciated, thanks in advance.</p>	"

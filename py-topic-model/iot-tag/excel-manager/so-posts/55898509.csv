55898509,98453207,55898509,3,2,Mon Apr 29 07:14:00 EDT 2019,1567665,"Hi Matt. Few questions. Why is there a while(true) with a yield return? `First` and `second` attempt code will not be executed I think. It probably is not in the URL, but in the file that the URL points to. What is the content of the JSON file you have in the URL? It says it goes wrong on line 36 in GoogleSheetJSON. THe code you posted has commented code at line 36. WHat is the actual code ATM of the error?"
55898509,98453619,55898509,3,0,Mon Apr 29 07:30:00 EDT 2019,2416112,"I tried your code. If you are using SimpleJSON, `JSONObject` doesn't take arguments. Use JSONNode instead it works for me. Also @MikedeKlerk is right."

I've commented out the First and Second Attempts to test with the External URL. I've also updated the images. First image shows an error produced by linking to the JSON url I created; second image shows it working with the third party JSON url and code described in the question."

Each protocol has their own way to define an unique ID of the device. For example, some of them may contain the MAC address in the header, or some may contain the unique ID in the data.</p>	"

Sometimes it is not enough to get API because we have to handle non-API requirement or so many protocols which are not well defined.</p>		<p>Interactor(<a href="http://www.interactor.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">www.interactor.com</a>) is worth to check it and this solution might be good to check it too<br>	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmDVbgm2Oa4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmDVbgm2Oa4</a>	We can interact with things without coding, only through simple configurations just like router did.</p>		<p>There are a few pain points that we can meet when we need to handle IoT things. There are so many devices in IoT(Imagine the street that we are walking on). Many of them have different protocols and data types. Some of them might be out of production. I think this is the real problem for IoT. No matter how many companies released new IoT devices, we need to integrate all things on street with all things.</p>	"

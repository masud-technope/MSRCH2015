If you wish to create this configuration using the web UI, this is possible too but you need to get to the <em>Interfaces</em> section from the <em>Device Types</em> view: <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s733/sh/7fafea54-c925-4182-834f-794884de0298/a86cc082750d91b6/res/e4f2b0e4-fc23-468d-b384-3acc91a44185.png?resizeSmall&amp;width=832&amp;alpha=" rel="nofollow noreferrer">see this image</a></p>		<p>In this case, I clicked on the <code>Humidity Sensor</code> Device Type and then, in the expanded view, clicked on the <code>Interface</code> tab.

But I'm still not sure how to fetch devices's data from an external website using an http request. The above mentioned guide is not really applicable when you can't use the "manage schemas" section. I created a PI and an LI, created a API Key and token. I can't find a guide telling me how to use this set of data to request i.e. temperature values via php script. Btw, I'm new to his stuff, as you might have guessed. :) Thanks for your patience!"

These capabilities allow you to process the raw events in order to generate/compute state for the device.  This is more involved than simply retrieving the raw events because you need to configure schemas for the events and the state and then define the mappings that tell the platform how to compute the properties on the state when an event is received.  The computed state for a device is a different resource and needs to be retrieved using a different URL:</p>		<pre><code>GET /api/v0002/device/types/{typeId}/devices/{deviceId}/state/{logicalInterfaceId}	</code></pre>		<p>This is documented <a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/apis/swagger/v0002/state-mgmt.html#!/Devices/get_device_types_typeId_devices_deviceId_state_logicalInterfaceId" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>	"

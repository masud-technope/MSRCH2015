I have the php file to update the database, but to execute that I am trying with GET method. Unfortunately, it wan't working. The server received the request in the access.log, but wan't updating the database. Wanted to debug, so I had this question.</p>		<p>The entry in the access.log is as follows:</p>		<p>192.168.43.150 - - [18/Mar/2017:20:23:40 +0000] "GET collectdata.php?status=1 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 192.168.43.92\r\n\r\n" 400 0 "-" "-"</p>	"

If I want users to register their device, I assume that I have to give each device UUID and let the user enter that UUID. If the UUID is valid and doesnâ€™t overlap with other devices, then the user successfully register the device.</p>		<p>Assuming I am on the right track, should I make a list of arrays of devices and check if the user entered a valid UUID in the array? </p>		<pre><code>//Textfield where user enters their device ID	@IBOutlet weak var deviceIdTextfield: UITextField!		//I created a list of device array for example...	let deviceArray = ["device1", "device2", "device3", "device4", "device5"]		//If the user enters the device ID and press the button it checks if the ID is in the list of device array	@IBAction func registerButton(_ sender: Any) {	    deviceIdTextfield.text = deviceArray[0]	    print("success")}	</code></pre>		<p>My question is, First, is this the right way to approach making IoT apps?	Second, in the IBAction func, is there a way to check if my users device's ID is within my array? rather than giving a specific order like deviceArray[0].</p>		<p>Any advice or comments would be really helpful :)</p>	"

I'm following this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">instruction</a> . The IoT Core seems to be running fine. I can connect to it through the device portal. I have a remote PowerShell session opened to the device and I run the command that gets and runs the IotEdgeSecurityDaemon.ps1 script using the command from the mentioned instruction:</p>		<pre><code>. {Invoke-WebRequest -useb aka.ms/iotedge-win} | Invoke-Expression; `	Install-SecurityDaemon -Manual -ContainerOs Windows -DeviceConnectionString 'xxxxxx'	</code></pre>		<p>with the connection string being the primary connection string from the IoT Edge device that I added beforehand in the Iot Hub. That all looks fine.</p>		<p>I can see it getting moby-engine (this install script should take care of the installation of the required container engine?) and other prereqs it needs, but in the end, it can't start the iotedge runtime service. This seems related to the moby-engine not running or not being installed (without any logging at all). I have found an alternative  IotEdgeSecurityDaemon.ps1 script but before I start using that, I'd like to ask if anyone else has seen the same or similar problem with this particular setup.</p>		<p>regards,	derk</p>	"

55061036,96903072,55068916,3,0,Sat Mar 09 14:32:00 EST 2019,11170099,"ok you're saying that although I can install a windows os on the raspberry pi, i still can't use iot edge on that because it's not supported on iot core on an arm processor architecture? Makes sense. I guess i was assuming that microsoft would make sure to have iot edge working anywhere iot core was installed."

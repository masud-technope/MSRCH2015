Recently we purchased two more <code>TI SensorTag CC2650</code>, whose HW Rev: <code>1.3.2</code> and SW Rev: <code>1.2.1</code> to access temperature from these, TI sensorTags same handler didn't work instead it write(Enable) with <code>0x27</code> and read with <code>0x24</code>. </p>		<p>And the same thing happening with other sensors too, i.e. Humidity, Gyro etc.	Here is the link of <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/a/a8/BLE_SensorTag_GATT_Server.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">BLE SensorTag Attribute Table</a>.</p>		<p>Is this attribute table is same for both HW and SW Versions or different?</p>		<p>Any help and guidance will be welcome. </p>	"

You want to `connect` to the device you want and read using `char-read-uuid`.  That will fetch based on the UUID and not the handle.  The returned value will contain the handle so you can use it to get the correct handles for writing to the attributes to turn on the sensors."

40888340,69035164,40888340,3,0,Thu Dec 01 13:10:00 EST 2016,918558,"You should access attributes via their UUID.  The UUID won't change between revisions."

You can check the handler for each UUID of the sensor tag by doing this command:</p>		<pre><code>gatttool -b &lt;68:C9:0B:06:46:85&gt; --interactive	[68:C9:0B:06:46:85][LE]&gt; char-read-uuid F000AA01-0451-4000-B000-000000000000	handle: 0x0021   value: 00 00 00 00 //this is the result you want	</code></pre>		<p>Therefore, it is safer to actually write to it using UUID. Hope it helps :)</p>	"

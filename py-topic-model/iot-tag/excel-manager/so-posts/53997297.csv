I want to use this api to receive and display a chart on android screen. Is there any free library or chart view available in android? I don't want to use webview. I know about Hellocharts library but I don't know whether it is free or not and how to use it.</p>	"

But seriously I tried my best and tried to explore everything but I am not getting a single the starting point for implementing this. I am not asking for code but if someone can help me to get in flow then it would be really helpful for me. Thank you."
53997297,94840204,53997297,3,0,Wed Jan 02 05:43:00 EST 2019,429063,"Try something like "thinkspeak android examples" as a search term, on the web in general more than here."

But still I have not found any example related to chart API. Still I am continuing my search. Do you know how to use chart API in android ?"
53997297,94840312,53997297,3,0,Wed Jan 02 05:49:00 EST 2019,429063,"You may have to combine code from two distinct examples, one for thingspeak and one for charting.  That's *your job* - stackoverflow is neither a code finding service nor a code writing service."
53997297,94834652,53997297,3,0,Tue Jan 01 20:49:00 EST 2019,429063,"Stackoverflow doesn't really permit questions which ask how to do an *entire* task or which seek to find an off site resource or codebase.  Generally you need to do that kind of research on your own - questions here are reserved for *specific issues* within an overall problem, for example if you had code that was almost but not quite working."

Couldn't find any information about it (or maybe I might be using the wrong keywords). </p>		<p>I've got my GAE running on Java so I'd like to go into direction of running the MQTT broker on GAE using a backend.</p>		<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>	Did some further research and it seems Moquette is running on Java. Does someone have experience running Moquette on the GAE?</p>		<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong>	Ok, it seems the examples of Moquette are running using an OSGi container, which is unavailble in GAE. Looking for a script to start this server on GAE.</p>	"

Those are still not supported on normal AppEngine instances.</p>		<p>Note: GAE backends have been replaced: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/modules/#Java_Instance_scaling_and_class" rel="nofollow">now you just have</a> automatic scaled (aka frontend) instances and manual scaled (aka backend) instances.</p>		<p>Back to your problem: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/managed-vms/" rel="nofollow">Managed VMs</a> have most of the benefits of GAE (access to services), but run a full JVM, which allows listening sockets. </p>	"

Am I right that this client won't be needing the listening socket?"

We haven't tested it on GAE yet, but if you have any problems running it, you could ask in the support forum.</p>		<p>Update: If Peter Knego is right, then HiveMQ or any other MQTT broker won't work on GAE.</p>		<p>Full disclose: I'm working for the company, who develops HiveMQ.</p>		<p>Cheers,</p>		<p>Christian</p>	"

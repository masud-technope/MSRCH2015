I tested the MQTT broker which facilitates the publishing from my android phone and subscription of my IOT actuators(Motors). But I am confused, as how to enable actuators to work only from a particular publisher. In otherwords, I want to control my MotorA from my PhoneA and MotorB from PhoneB and so on... I don't know how to get started outside the localhost(LAN) to make my broker work with the help of internet.</p>		<p>I am using Mosquitto broker and ESP8266 as client. Please share your views on how to get started with Mosquitto broker hosted on internet.</p>	"

Hence, phone A could publish to queue <code>motor-a</code> and phone B could publish to queue <code>motor-b</code>. The application on the ESP8266 would subscribe to both and act accordingly.</p>	"

Sensors sending continuously data to RaspberryPi.</p>		<p>So I just wanted to analyse the data on Kaa Server like a controller, each time I will send data to this controller before pushing data directly into database I want to analyze the data.</p>		<p>For example: if sensed value of temperature is more then the allowed limit then it will send a command to RaspberryPi or some other controller to turn on or off heater or cooler according to their need.</p>		<p>Does it is possible to implement a controller like this on Kaa server side.</p>	"

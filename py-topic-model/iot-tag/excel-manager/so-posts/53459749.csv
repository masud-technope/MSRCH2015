These device sensors have connectivity issues so some metrics need to be calculated in a time window using statistical methods to get the count of telemetry events that trigger an alert.</p>		<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>		<p>Agregation window 1 hour, rules will be like taking the mode of sensors values and counting if the reach 10. Other rules should launch the alert with a bigger aggregation window like 12hs</p>		<p>Is there any way to accomplish this?</p>	"

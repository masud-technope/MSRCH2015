When blynkmyplant app open iOS settings and user changes Wi-Fi network, a local notification is displayed up immediately. How can this app monitor network change in background? </p>		<p>Apple reachability does not work in background, I have already tried it, also tried SCNetwork but does not seem to work in my iOS application. I have searched everywhere but all answers says that in background we cannot listen to network changes, my app has background modes also, but still cannot get network change block called.</p>	"

Also network connection can be checked not only directly by trying to connect some IP, system may have some kind of trick that allows to know if network is available without connecting. I would dig towards this ) Good luck!"

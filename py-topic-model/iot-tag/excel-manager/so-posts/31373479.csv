When trying to run the program on the remote machine, in either debug or release modes, the project deploys and runs successfully, however Visual Studio advises with a modal dialog box during the deployment process:</p>		<p>"Failed to create the web diagnostics object. The JavaScript Console and DOM Explorer may not work. Repairing the remote debugger installation may help".</p>		<p>Firstly, can I expect these tools to work on the Pi for a JavaScript Windows Universal App?</p>		<p>Secondly, I don't know how to repair or even access the remote debugger software. It seems to run automatically (msvsmon.exe, twice). Is here something to configure properly to get it to run?</p>		<p>Regards,</p>		<p>Paul</p>	"

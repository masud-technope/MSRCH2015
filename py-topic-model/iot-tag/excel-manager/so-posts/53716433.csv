When the temperature reaches a certain point, it will send an email through AWS SNS.	I have managed to make the system works as intended. However, the email I am receiving has the subject "AWS Notification Message". How to customize this title?</p>		<p>Some more detail: the rule is created in node-red, so node-red will only publish a warning message to AWS IoT when the temperature limit has been reached. AWS IoT only forward the content of the message to AWS SNS.</p>		<p>What I have tried so far: 	Setting the SNS email as JSON and RAW. In the case of RAW, there seems no way to set the subject. When I tried JSON, I used the following content as the message published through MQTT:</p>		<pre><code>{	    "subject" : "Warning message",	    "message" : "The temperature has reached 30deg"	}	</code></pre>		<p>However, when I set it as JSON the email never arrives.</p>		<p>Thank you.</p>	"

56018614,56018614,null,1,0,Tue May 07 08:37:00 EDT 2019,11463478,"<p>I am trying to record the distance measurement from a CEM/RS iLDM-30 laser distance meter, on a Windows 7 computer, via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). How do I make it connect to a BLE adapter plugged into my computer (e.g. Micro:bit) without using a mobile phone?</p>		<p>The serial connection to my computer is sorted out and I know how to handle the string once it is recorded, but I am having a hard time to actually read the string to my Bluetooth device. At the moment the device I am using is a BBC Micro:bit. With btlejack I am able to intercept the transmission once the laser distance meter is connected to my phone though the Meterbox Pro app, but I need a solution that does not require this initial connection, it must just connect straight to my Bluetooth receiver.</p>		<p>I have the device address, as it is detectable on my Windows machine on the Bluetooth devices list.</p>		<p>The code I currently have is this:</p>		<pre><code>bluetooth.startUartService()	basic.showIcon(IconNames.Yes)	basic.forever(function () { serial.writeString(bluetooth.uartReadUntil(serial.delimiters(Delimiters.NewLine)))	})	</code></pre>	"

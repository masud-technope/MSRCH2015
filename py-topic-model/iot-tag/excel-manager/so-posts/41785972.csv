Android Things only supports a single launcher app, and this behavior will be disabled in a future release.</li>	</ul>		<p>You have to uninstall the previous app (or close it) because it is holding an open connection to that pin.</p>		<p>You could uninstall that specific app like this:</p>		<pre><code> adb uninstall com.example.androidthings.simplepio	</code></pre>		<p>Bu you could also use a script to uninstall all other AndroidThings apps (which is handy when you have been playing with a lot of samples).</p>		<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/blundell/7c0c3bb17898b28fe8122b0dc230af50" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://gist.github.com/blundell/7c0c3bb17898b28fe8122b0dc230af50</a></p>		<p>download and run this script like: <code>./clear-android-things-apps.sh</code> and it will uninstall everything</p>	"

It can preform all kinds of tasks on the device but has a very bad user interface. It does this in a single Activity.</p>		<p><strong>User Interface Application</strong></p>		<p>This app has a shiny new interface but no bluetooth logic yet. Built with some Activities and Fragments.</p>		<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>		<p>How do I integrate the bluetooth app into my UI app? I need the bluetooth functionality to be accessible from different activities and fragments within the UI app. I still want to keep it modular and practice "separation of concern".</p>		<p><em>Ways Im thinking of are:</em></p>		<ul>	<li>I add the bluetooth app as a service so it can run	independently in the background. (This might not be good since I don't really need to keep the connection open always when not having the app open.)</li>	<li>I make a library out of the bluetooth application which I add to the UI app.</li>	<li>I break out the bluetooth functionality to a separate static class that I then add to the other application.</li>	</ul>	"

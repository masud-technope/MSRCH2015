Try to navigate to folder containing c file first and then compile it."

Our C SDK uses submodules for each protocol implementation	  and because of those submodules were not exist the build script failed</p>	</blockquote>		<p>Solution for this is to cross-compile Azure IoT SDK on Linux OS, which you can refer ashokkhurana's solution on <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/issues/435" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/issues/435</a>.</p>		<p>Hope this helps.</p>	"

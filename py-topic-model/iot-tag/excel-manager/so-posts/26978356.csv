Some good use cases are robots and quadcopters, 3D fabrication machines, remote asset monitoring, and audio processing.</p>		<p>Intel(R)  Galileo is an open source, Arduino-compatible platform that enables educators, students, and makers of all skill levels to quickly and easily engage in projects. It combines the simplicity of the Arduino development environment with the performance of Intel technology and the advanced capabilities of a full Linux software stack.</p>		<p>A really great place to learn more about both platforms is our online community at maker.intel.com.	You can join the conversation, find getting started guides, and share your projects in our project gallery.</p>	"

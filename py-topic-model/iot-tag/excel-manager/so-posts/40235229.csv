But i am developing an ionic app from which i'll be communicating frequently with this device. 	So i am using cordova-zeroconf-plugin. (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-zeroconf" rel="nofollow">https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-zeroconf</a>). 	I am seeing the services when i add watch for .local services. but my requestis faield when i use iotdevice.local in $http function. 	I have this code	<strong>App.js</strong></p>		<pre><code>if (window.cordova &amp;&amp; window.cordova.plugins &amp;&amp; window.cordova.plugins.Keyboard) {	  cordova.plugins.Keyboard.hideKeyboardAccessoryBar(true);	  cordova.plugins.Keyboard.disableScroll(true);	  console.log("device ready");	  var zeroconf = cordova.plugins.zeroconf;	  zeroconf.watch('_http._tcp.local.', function(result) {	    var action = result.action;	    var service = result.service;	    console.log(JSON.stringify(result));	    if (action == 'added') {	        console.log('service added', service);	    } else {	        console.log('service removed', service);	    }	  });			}	</code></pre>		<p>It works fine and in logs i see my device </p>		<blockquote>	  <p>{"action":"added","service":{"application":"http","domain":"local","port":80,"name":"iotdevice","server":"iotdevice.local.","description":"\00","protocol":"tcp","qualifiedname":"iotdevice._http._tcp.local.","type":"_http._tcp.local.","txtRecord":{},"addresses":["192.168.0.4"],"urls":["<a href="http://192.168.0.4:80" rel="nofollow">http://192.168.0.4:80</a>"]}}</p>	</blockquote>		<p>But when i use this in <strong>controller.js</strong>- </p>		<pre><code>$scope.sendRequest2 = function(){	    $http({	      method: 'GET',	      url: 'http://iotdevice.local/events?id=600194067eba&amp;action=socket1off'	    }).then(function successCallback(response) {	        $scope.req2succes=true;	        console.log("Sent");	      }, function errorCallback(response) {	        console.log(JSON.stringify(response));	        console.log("Could not Sent");	        $scope.req2succes=false;	      });	  }	</code></pre>		<p>It Doesn't work. Request status is always -1. 	can anyone help me how i can deal with his. Am i doing something fundamentally wrong ? </p>	"

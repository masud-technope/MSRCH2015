33885405,33935378,33885405,2,0,Thu Nov 26 09:51:00 EST 2015,3796048,"<p>ATA5590 chip operates in the 800-MHz to 1-GHz range and can achieve a range up to about 10 meters depending upon the interrogation device. Also called TAGIDU, the device contains 1344 bits of EEPROM, 1024 bits of user memory for the electronic product code, and 320 bits of system memory.</p>		<p>The forward interrogator to the tag can use either amplitude-shift keying (ASK) or double-sideband (DSB) modulation. The tag to interrogator modulation may be ASK or phase-shift keying (PSK), depending on the desired operation range, bit rate, and security mechanism. The data-rate range is 5 to 80 kbits/s.</p>		<p>The device can achieve a 10-meter range with an interrogator equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 4 W. Range is less than 4 meters with an EIRP of 500 mW. An anticollision function enables the operation of multiple tags within the field range for the reader. It can distinguish between up to 460 tags per second. Total tag power consumption is only 10 ÂµW.</p>		<p><a href="http://electronicdesign.com/communications/uhf-rfid-chip-extends-reading-range-10-meters" rel="nofollow">Source: UHF RFID Chip Extends Reading Range To 10 Meters</a></p>	"

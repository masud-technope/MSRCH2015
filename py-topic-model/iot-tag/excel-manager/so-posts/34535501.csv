I have been researching about saving files on the SD card and reading from it, but it's been tough. Not even the code below is running, for the line <code>IReadOnlyList&lt;StorageFile&gt; files = await folder.GetFilesAsync();</code> is causing the task to abort without raising any error. It's VS 2015 on Raspberry Pi 2.</p>		<pre><code>public async void pop()	{	    StorageFolder folder = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;	    IReadOnlyList&lt;StorageFile&gt; files = await folder.GetFilesAsync();	    foreach (StorageFile sf in files)	    {	        if (sf.Name.EndsWith(".mtk"))	        {	            var file = await folder.GetFileAsync(sf.Name);	            var readFile = await Windows.Storage.FileIO.ReadTextAsync(file);	            nextFileContents = readFile.ToString();	            break;	        }	    }	}	</code></pre>	"

With the use of Log Appenders, I am able to do so.	However, is it possible to do the same without adding any external db? I read in Kaa documentation that by default, Kaa stores data to MySQL (MaraidB / PostGre). 	However, when I tried to access Mysql (which is part of Kaa Sandbox), I was unable to do so.	Can anyone tell how can we do this?</p>	"

If you have any REST APIs to which the clients can post data to, then you can configure this. Please see [here](http://kaaproject.github.io/kaa/docs/v0.10.0/Programming-guide/Key-platform-features/Data-collection/Rest-log-appender/). Also check other [existing log appenders](http://kaaproject.github.io/kaa/docs/v0.10.0/Programming-guide/Key-platform-features/Data-collection/#existing-log-appender-implementations) too"

Some client use mqtt protocol and some uses websocket protocol due to their limitations. MQTT port is 1883 and websocket port is 8083. The problem is that I want to share all the topics on both port i.e. on websocket and MQTT. What type of configurations i should do in my MQTT broker or any other solution? </p>		<p>In other words I want to listen to all topics on websocket(port 8083) which are published on mqtt(port 1883) on same broker and vise versa.</p>		<p><strong>mosquitto.conf</strong> file is following</p>		<pre><code>allow_anonymous false	password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd		listener 8083 127.0.0.1	protocol websockets	</code></pre>	"

48685735,84410360,48685735,3,0,Fri Feb 09 12:37:00 EST 2018,4592073,"by default MQTT port is 1883 and its working on it."

48685735,84370600,48686056,3,0,Thu Feb 08 13:24:00 EST 2018,504554,"yes, that's what I said. It doesn't matter which protocol the client is connected with, it can publish and see all topics from all clients"
48685735,84380025,48686056,3,0,Thu Feb 08 17:02:00 EST 2018,4592073,"but when I publish any thing to a topic on port 1883(i.e. mqtt connection) I don't receive anything on port 8803 (i.e. on ws connection). even I have subscribed to all topics"

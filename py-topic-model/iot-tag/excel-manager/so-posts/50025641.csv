It's working fine but I don't understand how the node is registering at the gateway. I mean, where is the part in the code? </p>	"

Can I suggest you try using the LoRa LMIC library instead, this has a full implementation of LoRaWAN and can be used with TheThingsNetwork &amp; RFM95 modules - <a href="https://github.com/matthijskooijman/arduino-lmic" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/matthijskooijman/arduino-lmic</a>. </p>		<p>As for the gateway I am unsure of the Dragino gateway hardware / software, however I believe they are capable of acting as a Single Channel Gateway / Packet Forwarder. There is a decent forum thread here discussing how to use the Dragino gateway with TTN, <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/t/dragino-gateway/6154" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/t/dragino-gateway/6154</a> and the Dragino wiki has a comprehensive how to guide  <a href="http://wiki.dragino.com/index.php?title=Connect_to_TTN" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://wiki.dragino.com/index.php?title=Connect_to_TTN</a>. However there are short comings with single channel gateways, and some do not support downstream messages, so depending on your use case this may or may not be so useful.</p>		<p>If you can describe more in depth your use case I'd be keen to offer up more advice / ideas, I use LoRa a fair bit, but I only have experience with the Arduino Dragino hats not their gateway.</p>	"

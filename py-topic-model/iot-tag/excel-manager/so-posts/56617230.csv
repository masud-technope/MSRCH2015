Before start building the app I thought to get advice from experts. Does AWS / Azure IoT has any built-in mobile app which I can reuse or do I need to build app from scratch? I would really appreciate if anybody can share the whole process (Not AWS / Azure IoT communication but the steps to build mobile app for AWS / Azure IoT)</p>	"

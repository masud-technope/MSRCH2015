I managed to get current data within a specific bounding box using the Getpublicdata method, but the problem is that i need historical data. I have tried the Getmeasure method as well, but this results in an error due to permissions i guess.	So my questions is - is there a way to retrieve historical data for a specific area using the Netatmo API?</p>	"

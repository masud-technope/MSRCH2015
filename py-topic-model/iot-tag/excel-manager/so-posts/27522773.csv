A gateway device (currently an Intel Galileo board), will host an OMA-DM client and a LWM2M server.</p>		<p>The general scenario is that the nodes should be  able to be managed by any OMA-DM or LWM2M compliant device management server.</p>		<p>In case of an OMA-DM server, the commands will be sent to the gateway where they will be received by an OMA-DM client and passed on to the nodes directly as LWM2M commands or the client will use the APIs of the LWM2M server to create and send the message/command.</p>		<p>As such I wanted to know if there is any solution currently available that can help with this.</p>		<p>OR</p>		<p>Are there any guides or papers or any information of any kind to help me implement this solution?</p>	"

Now the issue coming is as soon as both devices start to work then inverter starts showing an error. I cannot understand why it was not giving with the Growatt device. Is there any solution?</p>	"

You must use a converter to convert from one form to the other. This question is better fitted for the Electrical Engineering site. You'll have a better chance for an answer there.

If yes => so, why you don't connect your server to inverter directly (I mean by using USB to the RS-485 converter). </p></li>	<li><p>What is your connection type? If it is Modbus-RTU you need to find Modbus register map to get your desired data. You could find this in the inverter user manual.</p></li>	</ul>		<p>Be careful about your Modbus communication configurations and settings (i.e. Baudrate, ID, Parity and Byte Size).  </p>	"

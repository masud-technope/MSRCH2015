I am using <a href="https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/3066/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MQTT client</a> form mendix app store for subscribing to device events.</p>		<p><strong>Project Explorer:</strong></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IGRAr.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IGRAr.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p><strong>Micro Flow</strong>	<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lBnVs.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lBnVs.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p><strong>MQTT Subscription</strong></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Vg5e.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Vg5e.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>I have also debug the micro-flow it is giving me value of output variable named <code>variable</code> = <code>false</code></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uYAGy.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uYAGy.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>and I have noticed that whenever app is started it is logs </p>		<blockquote>	  <p>subscribe: iot-2/type/TemperatureSensorSimulator/id/TemperatureSensorSimulator_1/mon	  as highlighted in micro-flow screenshot.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>All I want is my mendix app to be subscribed to a device on IBM watson IoT platform and show me events sent by device to IBM IoT platform. Can Anyone tell me how can I do this in mendix?</p>		<p>I have already subscribed to events in nodejs app everything is fine. App is showing me events in log. I think I am doing something wrong in mendix micro-flow. I have pasted all the screenshots here. Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated</p>		<p>Thanks in Advance. </p>	"

The rule is:</p>		<pre><code>iot-2/type/device_type/id/device_id/evt/event_id/fmt/format_string	</code></pre>		<p>So, yours should be:</p>		<pre><code>iot-2/type/TemperatureSensorSimulator/id/TemperatureSensorSimulator_1/evt/mon/fmt/json	</code></pre>		<p>You should be fine afterwards.</p>	"

Itâ€™s very easy and once you do it, it will automatically appear inside the Muzzley mobile app (search for muzzley on Google Play). </p>		<p>Regarding the Alljoyn protocol, we already have a draft connector using the LSF to control bulbs, and, the Alljoyn core to control the power plugs. The code is available on github and there is also a video available on youtube where you can find the following:</p>		<ul>	<li><p>Discovering the Alljoyn gateway and the local networked devices (bulbs)</p></li>	<li><p>Controlling the lamp through the internet on a 3G/LTE connection.</p></li>	</ul>		<p>Code here: <a href="https://github.com/muzzley/alljoyn-muzzley-connector" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/muzzley/alljoyn-muzzley-connector</a></p>		<p>Video here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STGvBIByFJI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STGvBIByFJI</a></p>		<p>This example is targeted to run on a x86-64 or openWRT platforms. If youâ€™d like to test drive it, please contact our support team at support@muzzley.com. As this is a Alljoyn preview connector you donâ€™t have it publicly available and youâ€™ll need some access tokens. </p>		<p>Finally, we are always trying to grow our list of compatible devices, so if you would like to develop your own device integration using the Muzzley app, even without alljoyn, weâ€™d love to help you.</p>		<p>Best regards,</p>		<p>Jorge Claro</p>		<p>Systems Integrator</p>		<p>Allseen Alliance Developer</p>	"

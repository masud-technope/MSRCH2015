In other words, when a new record is added in DynamoDB, I want it to be shown in my Servlet.</li>	</ul>		<p>Is there anyway to make this communication asynchronous (sockets for instance)?</p>		<p>I have searched on DynamoDB streams but I don't see how to open communication with AWS from my program. </p>	"

Independently, have your clients long-poll the servlet (or listen via websockets?) for updates."

Since I will open a socket endpoint in my servlet do I need to open another endpoint on DynamoDB ?Thank you."

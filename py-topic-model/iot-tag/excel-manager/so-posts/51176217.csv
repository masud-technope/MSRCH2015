51176217,89351054,51176217,3,1,Thu Jul 05 06:29:00 EDT 2018,6601582,"Why do you want to connect to port 15580. This port [used by the Edge Agent and 'iotedge' CLI to start, stop, and manage modules](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/blob/52ef77db24126bf473265fc09c53d35290a2dd6b/edgelet/contrib/config/windows/config.yaml#L94) and it is belongs to IoT Edge Daemon not edgeAgent."

But NodeMCU can directly connect to Azure IoT Hub.

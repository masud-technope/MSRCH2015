So I convert the virtual key to a string to the comparison.</p>		<p>I find the integer values differ from device to device, so "255" might be "175" in another setup. I hope it doesn't vary from startup to startup...</p>		<p>So to sum it up, this is an acceptable solution for my needs. I do feel as though either writing my own driver for the device may be the best situation but I don't have the time to do that in this project, nor the will right now to learn the subtilties of p/invoke and HID objects. </p>	"

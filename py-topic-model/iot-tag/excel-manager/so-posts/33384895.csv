Most of the time the embedded systems will be client of some remote server and they will be communicating to this remote server using the these <code>IoT</code> protocols.</p>		<p><code>MQTT</code> was trivial but other protocols aren't easily portable like I found no <code>Arduino</code> support for <code>CoAP</code>.</p>		<p>What are other protocols that can be embedded in <code>Arduino</code> (<code>Yun</code>)?</p>	"

You can simply import library in the Linux (<code>Linino</code>) side of <code>Yun</code> by accessing the root.</p>		<pre><code>ssh root@&lt;yunaddress&gt;	</code></pre>		<p>Use <code>Python</code> to create/import repository for the library you want for some specific protocol. To install some package like python, use:</p>		<pre><code>opkg install &lt;packagename&gt;	</code></pre>		<p>If you want to work with C/C++ libraries, work with:</p>		<pre><code>$ opkg install yun-gcc	$ opkg install make	</code></pre>		<p>Good luck!</p>	"

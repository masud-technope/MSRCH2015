Right now, I am having devices which are already sending data to server using HTTP POST and GET. </p>		<p>After struggling a lot for at-least 5-6 hours. I am not able to figure out how we can send data using HTTP POST to Kafka server. </p>		<p>Also, are there any good real life examples present on web which shows detailed configuration of KAFKA cluster that will be really helpful for beginner like me.</p>	"

But let's say that you know all that and still want to use HTTP.<br>	You need to bring up the Kafka REST Server in order to receive messages over HTTP. </p>		<p>Given that you're still learning, maybe the best course of action would be to use <a href="http://www.confluent.io/developer#documentation" rel="nofollow">Confluent's Kafka distribution</a> that comes with the <a href="http://docs.confluent.io/2.0.0/kafka-rest/docs/index.html" rel="nofollow">REST Proxy</a> and has a great documentation.</p>		<p>BTW Confluent is for Kafka what Datastax is for Cassandra, or Hortonworks/Cloudera is for Hadoop. It's a young company founded by the very creators of Kafka from LinkedIn.</p>	"

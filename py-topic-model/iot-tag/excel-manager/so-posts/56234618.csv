So how my code can determine which one is valid gateway and which is not?</p>		<p>I have a gateway code program that I made that can connect between iot sensor and my blockchain network and I want to add some validation code to it. I've been thinking that I can add some gateway list in my blockchain network and the gateway program code can validate itself. Is that possible and secure enough?</p>	"

At is it about security, you could try to ask on [Information Security](https://security.stackexchange.com/). But anyway you will have to give more details on what you want to control and where. In any site the current question is too broad."

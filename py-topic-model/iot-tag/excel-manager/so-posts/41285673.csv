The readings are always fluctuating somewhat, and the "hop" at the beginning is a tank refill which is "normal". On Sep 16  the sensor started to malfunction and just gives apparent random values after that.</p>		<p>As a programmer ideally I'd like a simple way of detecting the problem (and as soon after it starts as possible).</p>		<p>I can mess about with "if direction of vector between two hourly averages changes direction more than once per day it is unstable". But I guess there are more sound and stable algorithms out there.</p>	"

I.e. in case of the example, if </p>		<pre><code>t1-t2 &gt; 5	</code></pre>		<p>assuming t1 and t2 show the tank capacity at hourly intervall. You might want to add sensor accuracy related safety margin.</p></li>	<li><p>past data based: Assuming that all tanks are similar regarding output capacity and used sensor quality, calculate the following for all your data of non-faulty sensors:</p>		<pre><code>max(t1-t2)  	</code></pre>		<p>The result is the error threshold to be used, similar to the value 5 above.</p></li>	</ul>		<p>Note: tank refill operation might require additional consideration.</p>		<p>Additional methods are described e.g. here.

Standard deviation is an easy formula, and well known. Look for a high value, and you know there's a problem.</p>		<p>You can also use coefficient of variation, which is the ratio of the mean to standard deviation.</p>	"

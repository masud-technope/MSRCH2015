You can get cheap PCBs from China if you are willing to wait several weeks and don't have to high expectations regarding quality.</p>		<p>Having a single PCB manufactured and populated will most likely cost you a few houndred dollars, depending on how many layers you have, how many components...	It would be much cheaper to populate it yourself.</p>		<p>Now looking at your post I'd say you don't have too much experience so you will most likely need several iterations until you get the board right.</p>		<p>Do you really need your own board? Why not something off-the-shelf?	Do you really need a professionally made PCB?	Will it ever pay off?	There are enough methods to make your own prototype PCBs on the cheap.</p>		<p>I think you should discuss your design and manufacturing plans with someone who has experience. Reach out to the EEVBlog forums and provide more information than you did here.</p>	"

My plan it to create a   small arduino like pcb with all the components i need do my proof of concept product. I am very new to the world of electronics so hitting many walls right now."
45794723,78717520,45796262,3,0,Fri Aug 25 10:44:00 EDT 2017,2858170,"@Rahul you can get breakout-boards for pretty much any package if they don't fit into a breadboard anyway so often it's not cost-effective to have pcb manufactured for simple prototyping. but you can definitely safe a lot of money if you populate the board yourself as setup time of all the pick an place equipment only pays of in mass production. it's super expensive for a few or even a single board."

Fritzing is an easy to use layout software and they have their own <a href="https://aisler.net/fritzing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fabrication service</a>.  Their tools are easy to use and economical for low production runs.  Alternatively, <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Seeed Studio</a> offers a PCB fabrication and assembly service.</p>		<p>Generally, if you are in the prototyping stage it can be cost prohibitive to automate the PCB assembly process with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMT_placement_equipment" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pick and place machine</a>, so the assembly is done by hand.  You may find it cheaper to learn to solder or find a friend to assemble your board.</p>	"

45794723,78731920,45806805,3,1,Fri Aug 25 17:13:00 EDT 2017,8217771,"Not in their basic service, but you can pay for components and stencils.  I updated the answer with a reference to Seeed Studio which does do assembly.  You'll need to compare prices yourself for your specific board layout.  Even if you have made a breadboard prototype of your circuit, there can be new issues that are discovered during the PCB fab process.  You may be able to save a lot of money if you do _not_ pay for an assembly service and do it yourself.  Be prepared to do multiple iterations of your PCB."

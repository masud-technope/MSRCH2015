Is it right?</p>		<p>Here I want to make watch as central and smartphone as peripheral is it possible?(I cant make watch as peripheral because it will be always connected to some other peripherals as a central, so it cannot be a central and peripheral at the same time )</p>		<p>And the final question is  that  my assumption to make smartphone as a peripheral and watch as central  is correct or not?	(  1.)more data has to be sent from watch to phone.	2.) watch will be already connected other ble devices as a central.)</p>		<p>I am using bluetopia 4.0 stack in watch.</p>	"

It depends on the properties and permissions of the characteristics in the GATT service.</p>		<p>The decision to make a device as Central or Peripheral depends on the use case and a variety of parameters like data rate, power consumption  etc.</p>	"

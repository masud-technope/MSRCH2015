43090286,43090286,null,1,0,Wed Mar 29 09:59:00 EDT 2017,4614104,"<p>I've been working with the PicoBorg Reverse motor board to control a DC motor. My application is written in C# and communicates with the board which is connected to a Raspberry Pi through I2C. The Raspberry Pi has DMAP enabled so I am using the Lightning provider by Microsoft.</p>		<p>The code for controlling the motor is:</p>		<pre><code>private I2cDevice picoBorgRevDevice;  	I2cController controller = await I2cController.GetDefaultAsync();	picoBorgRevDevice = controller.GetDevice(new I2cConnectionSettings(0x44));	picoBorgRevDecive.Write(buffer)	</code></pre>		<p>Buffer contains two bytes, one with the command and one with the value. These commands can be found here (<a href="https://github.com/CodyErekson/picoborgrev/blob/master/lib/constants.js" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/CodyErekson/picoborgrev/blob/master/lib/constants.js</a>)</p>		<p>I am currently using WriteReadPartial but the byte I get back is empty, although the result is FullTransfer. </p>		<pre><code>byte[] command = new byte[1] {I2cCommands.GET_A}; // GET_A is 5	byte[] data = new byte[3];	result = picoBorgRevDevice.WriteReadPartial(command, data);	</code></pre>		<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>	"

Finding it  hard to understand few details . Documentation is limited on it. We were told a requirement was to configure multiple clients . Does that mean each end point will have its own object ids according to lwm2m ? What will be unique for each client ? What we understood was each client has several objects like location , device , access control , security etc . Is there any good documentation out there or can someone give us a pointer for basic hierarchy of lwm2â€™ ? </p>	"

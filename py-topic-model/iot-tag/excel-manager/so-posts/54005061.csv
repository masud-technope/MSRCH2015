When the status is switching all the time probably the docker container is terminating all the time (probably because the application is crashing). You should the that on the status tab of the application in the event log (container is restarted all the time).</p>		<p>If you are on the newest Cumulocity version (9.19.x) you should also have access to the logs of the microservice at the same place in UI. You need to log to stdout in order to be able to get the logs through administration application.</p>	"

Sometimes it says the service is down when it's actually up. I check the /health endpoint to be sure(it's not available right after you upload the zip, takes 5-6 minutes).  </p>		<p>The logs in the UI are a bit clunky, so I've added a rolling file appender to logback.xml and a rest endpoint to expose the log file for debugging.</p>	"

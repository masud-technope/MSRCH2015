It seems I can have an user authentication (user/password but I prefer a token based, but that's another question). 	Everything I read it seems to handle whether user can access the server or not, but not sure if I can establish permissions to restrict if a client can or not subscribe to a particular publication (something file permissions in unix)</p>		<p>I'm looking at docs and seems there is no option to handle it or to delegate this control, so I guess it can't be done. But I would like to know for sure</p>	"

This combined with settings the <code>allow_annonymous</code> argument to false will make sure you can only connect to the broker as an authenticated user.</p>		<p>The <code>acl_file</code> config option points to the list of ACLs that control what a topics a given user can subscribe or publish to. It uses the following format:</p>		<pre><code>user &lt;username&gt;	topic [read|write|readwrite] &lt;topic&gt;	pattern [read|write|readwrite] &lt;topic-pattern&gt;	</code></pre>		<p>A username, followed by lines that give a specific topic or topic pattern and what level of access that user should have. (patterns can contain <code>%c</code> to substitute for the clientID or <code>%u</code> to substitute for the username).</p>		<p>As well as the file based support, mosquitto has a authentication plugin api which means you can off load all that information to code that can look users and acls up in a database. There is an example plugin by JPMens <a href="https://github.com/jpmens/mosquitto-auth-plug" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/jpmens/mosquitto-auth-plug</a></p>	"

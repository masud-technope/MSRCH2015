To do this, I builded the Python 2.7 library for AIH and got the valid library named iothub_client.so. To test if the lib is ok I just tried to do a simple import like: from iothub_client import * and it worked.	<br>So, After this I setup the connection string as described <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/get_started/python-run-sample.md" rel="nofollow">here</a> and ran the script from the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/python/device/samples/iothub_client_sample.py" rel="nofollow">this sample</a>. <br>	This is the output of the app:</p>		<pre><code>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ================================ RESTART ================================	&gt;&gt;&gt; 		Python 2.7.9 (default, Mar  8 2015, 00:52:26) 	[GCC 4.9.2]	IoT Hub for Python SDK Version: 1.0.13	Starting the IoT Hub Python sample...

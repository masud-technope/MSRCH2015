Thanks in advance.  </p>	"

It should not be too expensive, and will typically operate by sending data (and control information) over a UART serial link. This limits the data rate, but in many applications you probably don't care about data rate.</p>		<p>You might want to check the example software when selecting a modem/shield.</p>		<p>Bear in mind that the various bands are not global, so you need to make sure that whatever you use, it matches your region.</p>	"

It provides a set of <a href="https://www.espruino.com/datasheets/SIM900_AT.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">AT commands</a> which can be used for getting the contents of a web page and posting variables through a GPRS connection.</p>		<p>Various open source libraries are available for Arduino platform. You Can start from there and later write your own code or simply copy the code.</p>	"

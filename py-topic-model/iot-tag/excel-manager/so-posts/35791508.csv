Do you need to write component-specific drivers, or are you planning to reuse components already programmed (that expose an API)? Do you want to provide a backend service for IoT devices, or do you want to program "the things"?	Anyway, I assume from your question that you are new to the topic, so I would say that until you reach the point of needing to write/compile C code you can develop and/or interface with most of the common prototyping boards via .NET.</p>		<p>You may have a look at the following links:</p>		<p>Arduino interfacing: <a href="http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Csharp" rel="nofollow">http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Csharp</a></p>		<p>Windows 10 IoT: <a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/iot" rel="nofollow">https://dev.windows.com/en-us/iot</a></p>		<p>RaspberryPI.Net: <a href="https://github.com/cypherkey/RaspberryPi.Net" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cypherkey/RaspberryPi.Net</a></p>	"

35791508,59255718,35791940,3,0,Fri Mar 04 09:56:00 EST 2016,3041939,"Then you can do all this without writing code in C. The devices you want to get data from are most probably already equipped with (or ready for being equipped with) a full network stack that allows you to send the data over the web. Your main effort would be to expose a web service and let the devices send data to it. If devices are sensors that have low or no access to power supply, I'd suggest to use simple UDP packets.		Your idea seems to be similar to Yaler.net (hope this is not against StackOverflow rules): https://yaler.net/ - this could give you an idea of what needs to be done."

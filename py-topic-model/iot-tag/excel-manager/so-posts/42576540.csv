Everything was going fine until I tried to download virtual fire alarm device agent. </p>		<p>Simple, it was not working, and a blank page with no response was all that I have got. Then I tried the same for a Raspberry Pi device, and again the device agent failed to be downloaded. It is interesting that this bug was reported for Alpha and 3.1.0 product versions, so it seemed that the current official version is free from this.</p>		<p>Do you have any explanation of this ill behavior (it doesn't seem to me that anything is missing in the documentation)?</p>	"

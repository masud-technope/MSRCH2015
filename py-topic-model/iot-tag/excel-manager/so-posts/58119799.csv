Is there any other way to route data	  and make my own application thats not theirs?</p>	</blockquote>		<p>I'm using a product called Grasp.io Cloudio which is an add-on board to rasp-berry pi that collects and sends sensor data to Grasp.io hosted cloud server. The company also have a mobile app that allows me to code and receive back notifications about the sensor data from this smart home device. </p>		<p>I want to know how to develop my personal app instead of theirs to make it more tweak-able. For this I need their API?</p>		<p>I also want to retrieve data from their cloud server outside of their app. This is to remove the limitation set by them such as the maximum number of notification that can be sent in an interval and delay between notifications. If the limitation could not be removed, then instead of using the server, the device can route the data to my personal machine directly, so I can remove this delay. </p>		<p>The company support hasn't been replying my mails, and I cannot retrieve any APIs (not that I know how to play with APIs, but I think it would be good to have them). </p>		<hr>		<p>Things I tried:	Studied into pen testing (but my project discourage me to do this). 	Emailed support but did not get reply multiple times. 	Read their FAQ page. 	Learning the basics of raspberry pi and linux.</p>	"

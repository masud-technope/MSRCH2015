To be more specific the steps that I am trying to achieve are the following:	1) Register my CA with AWS IoT.	2) Create a thing entry in the registry for my device.	3) Generate a certificate for my device signed by my CA.	4) Associate the certificate created above with device created in the registry so that it can be authenticated when it connects.</p>		<p>How do I perform step 4) programmatically using the API or AWS-SDK in android?</p>	"

As I'm new to AWS but according to my knowledge the principal API can take certificate ARN in principal parameter. Actually we have 3 items to authenticate. 1.) ECC certificate 2.) ECC Key (Private Key) and 3.) CA certificate. Using these certificate received from the device, the app will then subscribe to the AWS-IOT thing shadow. I am not able to get whether we have to use an or AWS-SDK methods"

And then you can attach the uploaded certificate with the device."

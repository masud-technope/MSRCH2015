Board software is latest available, and I am developing using the Eclipse based IDE.	Bluez version number in this edison release is 5.37.</p>		<p>I am designing a system which has to meet the following requirements:</p>		<ul>	<li>Scan for bluetooth devices nearby. [X]</li>	<li>Detect sensor devices based on name and MAC address. [X]</li>	<li>Pair and connect sensor devices automatically. []</li>	</ul>		<p>Last item is the problem since I can detect sensor devices but I am not able to pair them using the bluez5 interface. So far I have tried to use the D-BUS interface but it is not working since I keep getting the following error message:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>Method "FindAdapter" with signature "s" on interface "org.bluez.Manager" doesn't exist</p>	</blockquote>		<p>Code is presented here. Please note:</p>		<ul>	<li>DBusConnection *conn -> DBUS_BUS_SYSTEM</li>	<li>const char *adapter -> "hci0".</li>	</ul>		<p>Code:</p>		<pre><code>DBusMessage *msg, *reply;	DBusError err;	const char *reply_path;	char *path;		msg = dbus_message_new_method_call("org.bluez", "/","org.bluez.Manager", "FindAdapter");	dbus_message_append_args(msg, DBUS_TYPE_STRING, &amp;adapter,DBUS_TYPE_INVALID);	dbus_error_init(&amp;err);	reply = dbus_connection_send_with_reply_and_block(conn, msg, -1, &amp;err);	dbus_message_unref(msg);	</code></pre>		<p>Any ideas?</p>	"

To call these methods you can send dbus messages (like you did in the code presented above) or build a Proxy object with the following parameters (found in the documentation) :</p>		<p>name : "org.bluez"</p>		<p>interface "org.bluez.Device1"</p>		<p>path : "/org/bluez/dev_AA_BB_CC_DD_EE" where AA_BB_CC_DD_EE is your device mac address.</p>		<p>If you choose to build a proxy object, you can call methods like Pair or Connect through the proxy.</p>		<hr>		<p>Could you explain what you are trying to achieve in the code above ? I understand that you want to find which adapter to use (I see the "FindAdapter" method) however it seems you already knows that your adapter name is "hci0". </p>		<hr>		<p>I have been working with the DBus API exposed by Bluez recently and I was unfamiliar with the interface "org.bluez.Manager".</p>		<p>After a quick search in the official documentation (<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/doc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://git.kernel.org/cgit/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/doc</a>) I was able to find the following commit which specifies that the interface was dropped in 2012 : 	<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/bluetooth/bluez.git/commit/doc?id=86a7b07c22f3a595ba3c48092359287905bf0878" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://git.kernel.org/cgit/bluetooth/bluez.git/commit/doc?id=86a7b07c22f3a595ba3c48092359287905bf0878</a></p>		<p>I also noticed you were using the DBus low-level API, as advised by freedesktop themselves (read at the bottom of the page here : <a href="https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/group__DBus.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/group__DBus.html</a> ), this is very complex API useful to create bindings in other languages. If you can, switch to GLib GDBus  for a much simpler API.</p>	"

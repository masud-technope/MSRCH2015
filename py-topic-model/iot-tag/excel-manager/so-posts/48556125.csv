What I found is that they are using different protocol(tcp, serial) and data type(binary, xml, text). Colleague recommend some way like middleware or libraries but I doubt if it is efficient for maintenance or not.  </p>	"

It is easy to use, but there might be multiple adjustments needed for matching middleware requirements.</p>		<p>You can use library as a joint. If you have suitable library, you can easily connect using minimum extra programming. You might have to use multiple libraries, and additional libraries could be needed when new, unsupported components are added.</p>		<p>Custom development is a traditional way. It is time-consuming job, but If you code everthing, you don't need any other help.</p>		<p>I heard declarative backend software like Interactor might be another solution. You can construct connections and make your own logic with smaller resources.</p>	"

You're discussing this topic at such a high level that it doesn't really provide any technical value. That's why I voted to close the question as "Too broad"."

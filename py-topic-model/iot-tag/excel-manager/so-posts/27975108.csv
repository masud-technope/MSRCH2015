I just need the iOS Library for discovering and pairing with a device. Then to transmit data to it. Is MFi still necessary for doing this?"

27975108,44343005,27975108,3,1,Fri Jan 16 00:00:00 EST 2015,3418066,"As far as I know in order to do this from entirely within your app your device needs to support the Wireless Accessory Configuration feature, which requires joining the MFi program - which you will need to do for HomeKit access anyway."
27975108,44377049,27975108,3,1,Fri Jan 16 21:37:00 EST 2015,3418066,"Yes, WAC is covered by MFi."

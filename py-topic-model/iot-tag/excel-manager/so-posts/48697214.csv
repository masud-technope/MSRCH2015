When executes excecv system call, the www service dies(or is killed?) immediately.	I don't know why this happens, and how to overcome it.	Someone told me, "My guess is that there was a mechanism which monitor the service and kills it when it does not responds."	I'm not sure if such mechanism exists in linux or not.	Can anyone explain the correct reason this happens?</p>	"

Can you confirm that the ESP8266 can connect to any internet service at all e.g. a simple http request? Second though, I don't see any package on PyPI called `smtplib`. smtplib itself is part of the standard Python distribution and the only MicroPython versions on PyPI are dummy placeholders. [This](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=5278) might be worth a look though."

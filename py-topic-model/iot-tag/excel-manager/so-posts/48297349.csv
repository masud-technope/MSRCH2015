Installed Kaa v010.0 on an EC2 instance Ubuntu 16.04, ran multiple android emulations, tried adding a java program running as a device as assisted attachment, it attached on the first android app user, on the second android app user it could not attach. SO I guess the answer is NO, the device can not have more than one owner."

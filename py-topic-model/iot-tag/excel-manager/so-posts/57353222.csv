Made appropriate adapter changes to make client work with IOT Azure C SDK. We observe "Bad Certificate" error thrown by client on wire shark error. From wireshark we are certain that client sends "Hello" on which Server (IOT Hub) responds "Server Hello, Certificate, Certificate Request, Server Hello Done". It is here when client tries authenticate server certificate we see "Bad Certificate" being thrown. We are attaching in mail the root certificate we are adding to client and the wireshark we see stating bad certificate.</p>		<p><img src="https://afkiddeactiveevac28.blob.core.windows.net/azuredevice/BadCertError.png" alt="Device Error"></p>	"

Smartphones connect them and perform some actions. I want smartphones to connect multiple devices and control them and in the meantime I dont want internet access of the smartphones to disconnect. What I want to ask is which wireless protocol would be good for this job. Should I use WiFi, Bluetooth, Wifi-Direct or anything else ?</p>		<p>Actually, according to my searches, "WiFi-Direct" seems good option to me, but I wanted ask to you whether it is a good options or not. In addition, please state which specific module can be used such as "HC-06" "ESP8266" and why? while stating which protocol is good for me.  Thanks in advance :)</p>	"

Answer is depends on many aspects:</p>		<ul>	<li>What range do you want you sensors support (how far they should stay connected)?</li>	<li>How many sensors do you want to support?</li>	<li>How your sensors are powered up (power line or battery)?</li>	<li>What smartphones do you want to support?</li>	<li>How much data and how frequently they send?</li>	<li>And other... </li>	</ul>		<p>Let me cover these topics a little more:<br/></p>		<h3>Range</h3>		<p>This is the easiest one. Bluetooth (depending on class, usually it's II) have a range about 10m (30ft). Wi-Fi (and Wi-Fi Direct which is almost the same) have range about 30m (100ft). So if all your sensors located on a user's body (like wearables) or at the desk (like mice, keyboard) then Bluetooth is fine. If devices are spread over larger area (like temp-sensors in each room), then Wi-Fi based protocol is better.</p>		<h3>Number of devices</h3>		<p>This is also quite easy. Bluetooth is capable of connecting not more than 8 devices. One of them is master and up to 7 slave devices. Wi-Fi can handle theoretically up to 255 devices, but in practice it's less (due to interference). Usually if you have more then 20-25 devices you need another access point.</p>		<h3>Power</h3>		<p>If your devices are connected to a power-line (like smart wall sockets or smart light bulbs) then they easily be connected using Wi-Fi. But if it's a button-cell battery then it better be Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) (a.k.a Bluetooth Smart or Bluetooth 4.0). However there are examples where TV remote control running on 2 AAA batteries uses Wi-Fi Direct.</p>		<h3>Smartphones support</h3>		<p>Android can do anything, but iPhone is a headache. It does not support Wi-Fi Direct, it does support Bluetooth, but only limited number of BT profiles. If you need to support other BT profiles you need to participate in Apple MFi program and got a license and certification from Apple. Another option is to use Bluetooth Smart technology (BLE). More information about Apple restrictions are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bluetooth/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and in the <a href="https://mfi.apple.com/MFiWeb/getFAQ.action" rel="nofollow">FAQ</a>.</p>		<p>I won't advice about concrete chip-sets, because there are so much choices on a market, also I don't know your budget. However you can try to look at well know brands like Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Marvell and etc. - they provide a chip-sets for any choice and gust. </p>		<p>If you need to support iPhone and all other requirements (range, amount of sensors, etc.) are OK with Bluetooth, I would recommend to use Bluetooth Smart (BLE) as a simplest choice.</p>	"

Devices are plugged so there is no power issue and I need IPhone, Android and Windows Phone support. I also thought BLE would be best option for this scenario."

It has a fairly bandwidth constrained 3G connection to the outside world.</p>		<p>Does anyone know of a platform which can provide the following (or at least a subset of the following):</p>		<ol>	<li>A Publish/Subscribe interface to send/receive real time data streams</li>	<li>A (very) compact/compressed time series oriented transmission protocol for bandwidth-constrained devices</li>	<li>A database to store the data samples in a compact format</li>	<li>A REST-ful query-based API to retrieve historic data samples</li>	<li>A GUI javascript? dashboard capable of real time and historic graphing capabilities</li>	</ol>		<p>The majority of platforms I have found are designed to work in the domain of  seconds rather than milliseconds and/or use string-heavy data formats such as JSON.</p>	"

Open source sketches for this are available <a href="https://github.com/axibase/arduino/tree/master/dataTransmission" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>	"

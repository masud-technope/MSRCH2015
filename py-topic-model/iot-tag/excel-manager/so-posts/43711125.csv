I need to detect anomalies in vibration patterns.	Given we have enough historical data, how would you go about creating models for this problem?</p>	"

This is assuming your data can fit into memory, else you may want to consider setting up an Hadoop or Spark cluster on Amazon EC2 or other virtual clusters. </li>	<li>You should perform some <strong>EDA</strong> to understand your data better. This will reveal more on the underlying struture of the data, what kind of distribution is it from, etc.</li>	<li>Make rough <strong>visual plots</strong> of your data if possible. This will come in handy when you need to polish some final plots for a presentation when reporting your analysis.</li>	<li>Based on the EDA, you can then intuitivey prepare your data for processing. You may need to <strong>transform, rescale or standardize the dataset</strong> before applying any <em>Machine Learning</em> technique for Anomaly detection.</li>	<li>For <strong>supervised datasets</strong> (i.e. labels are provided), you may consider algorithms such as SVM, Neural Networks, XGBoost or any other appropriate supervised technique. <em>However, great care much be taken in evaluating the results because typical to anomaly detection datasets</em>, there is more often than not a very small number of positive examples (y = 1) with respect to the total number of examples. This is called <strong>class imbalance</strong>. There are various ways of mitigating this problem. See <a href="http://www.chioka.in/class-imbalance-problem/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Class Imbalance Problem</a>.</li>	<li>For <strong>unsupervised datasets</strong>, techniques such as the density based methods (i.e. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and its varieties, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) -> its a very popular method), One-class SVM, etc. A monograph of unsupervised methods for anomaly detection is detailed in this study. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152173#sec008" rel="nofollow noreferrer">A Comparative Evaluation of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Algorithms for Multivariate Data</a></li>	</ol>		<p><strong>N.b.</strong>.<br>	 - Don't forget to consider rudimentary ML practices when building your models such as: splitting into training set/ test set or exploring resampling methods such as k-fold CV, LOOCV, etc to control bias/ variance in your results.<br>	 - Explore other techniques such as Ensemble methods (i.e. Boosting &amp; Bagging algorithms) to improde model accuracy.<br>	 - Deep learning techniques such as the <strong>Muli-layer Perceptron</strong> can be explored on this problem. If there is some time-series component, a <strong>Recurrent Neural Network, RNN</strong> can be explored.</p>	"

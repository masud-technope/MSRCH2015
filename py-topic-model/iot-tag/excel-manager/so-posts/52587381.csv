I achieved to send the alerts to users when condition matches by using following	steps</p>		<pre><code>1)store threshold values,condition of a device in mysql.	2)when the device data comes to server i checked the current value with given condition with threshold value and send the alert.	3)And also their are multiple conditions associated with devices so i need to check each and every condition.	</code></pre>		<p>So what i need is like,is their any technology that i can use in my project.</p>	"

You can store threshold values and condition of a device in Azure Database for MySQL or other MySQL host.</p>		<p>Azure IoT Hub supports communications both from the device to the cloud and from the cloud to the device. We can use Azure IoT Hub to monitor the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/quickstart-send-telemetry-dotnet" rel="nofollow noreferrer">telemetry</a> data. Azure Function can process the data from Azure IoT Hub. An <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/functions-js-iot-hub-processing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">article</a> here shows how to capture data from your devices or sensors, perform aggregation, filtering or some other custom processing on this data, and store it on a database. It is a typical tutorial for your scenario. </p>		<p>I am not sure if it is a better solution for you, hope that helpful.</p>	"

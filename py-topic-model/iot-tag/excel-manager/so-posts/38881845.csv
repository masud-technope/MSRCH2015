Below is the code sample you can follow,</p>		<pre><code>        using (var SW = File.AppendText(@"Arquivo.txt"))	        {	            SW.WriteLine("Evento Gerado em: " + DateTime.Now.ToString() + Humidity + Temperature + "\n\r");	        }	</code></pre>		<p>The using clause will automatically call the Dispose method when out of scope.</p>		<p>Actually, if you look at the .NET <a href="http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/io/streamwriter.cs,9e38cb1c84769eba" rel="nofollow">code</a>, line 231, calling Close() is equivalent of Dispose() except it's telling the CLR not to call the finalizer of the object.</p>		<p>I guess you'll be just fine using the snippet above in your UWP app.</p>		<p>By the way, if you want to save to a txt file on an external storage, you'll need to explicit declare the capability in the project manifest file, in the "Declarations" tab, add "File Type Associations", and one scheme with the extension of "txt". It applies to other file formats as well.</p>	"

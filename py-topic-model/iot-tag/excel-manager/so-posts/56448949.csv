I assume this is the name of my iOS app?  Does anyone have an example of a working call that uses "schema"?</p>		<p>For example I have tried "sensorstat" and "com.status.sensor" while calling API "get user list".  I expected the API to give me a list of users registered through the application.</p>		<p>I get a permission denied response.:	{	    "code": 1106,	    "msg": "permission deny",	    "success": false,	    "t": 1559669799846	}</p>	"

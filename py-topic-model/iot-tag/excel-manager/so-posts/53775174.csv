But I moved all of my Azure resources to a different subscription now. And I need to do the Azure Device Provisioning again so that the MXChip device can be provisioned with a new connection string. But when I try to do the commands it shows only one subscription. </p>		<pre><code>IoT Workbench: Cloud	Azure Provision	</code></pre>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KsPqj.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KsPqj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>Any idea what to do in this case? </p>	"

Please also open browser console and share what command is sent for loading data and what is the response (if data is loaded via WebSocket - you will need to open browser console, refresh the page and filter network requests by WebSockets)"

53165479,93229235,53165479,3,0,Tue Nov 06 10:12:00 EST 2018,10519790,"When aggregation type is 'NONE' - you need to set 'Max Values' property - it is a max number of data points that are returned for the selected time interval. I think that in your case you are reaching the 'Max values' limit. Also Note that in most cases, when you show data on a chart, you do not need to disable aggregation. Thingsboard knows how to correctly aggregated values for different time intervals."
53165479,93229255,53165479,3,0,Tue Nov 06 10:12:00 EST 2018,10519790,"Also The current limit of max aggregation points has a reason: if you want to display data in a chart on standard screen, with resolution is 1920x1200 pixels - each point will consume ~4 pixels. For human it is really hard to analyze charts with such a lot of points. For example, please open our live demo and configure time window for showing max allowed aggregation point and you will see that it is really hard to detect patterns on the chart. It will be not user-friendly."

To display data for 1 day and more, i would need to set the aggregation type, are you able to advise the reason? thanks alot for your help"

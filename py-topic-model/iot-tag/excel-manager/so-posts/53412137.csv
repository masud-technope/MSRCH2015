You have a few options.</p>		<ol>	<li>You can connect the broker with Lambda, to Kinesis, SNS etc. So your receive handler can exist in lambda.</li>	<li>You can write code to subscribe to the MQTT broker yourself and put it in EC2, ECS etc with proper IAM roles/policies. The IoT endpoint in fact is a MQTT broker so thats the only config you will need to receive messages. The endpoint is visible on AWS IoT > Settings > Custom Endpoint</li>	</ol>		<p>Lambda to receive messages will look something like this where event is an inbound MQTT message</p>		<pre><code>const AWS = require('aws-sdk');		exports.handler = (event, context, callback) =&gt; {	    const id = event.id;	    const chan0 = event.chan0;	}    	</code></pre>	"

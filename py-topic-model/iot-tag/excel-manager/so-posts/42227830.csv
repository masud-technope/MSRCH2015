Maximum packet size ? 	can I send an image or a sound using ble ?</p>	"

In reality at least around a millisecond must be allocated to serve each connection event. So if you use a 7.5 ms connection interval you could not expect more than at maximum 10 connections without getting dropped packets (and therefore larger latency). Connection setup/scanning will also miss a large amount of packets if the radio is busy handling current connections.</p>		<p>The maximum packet length is 31 bytes for advertisements (up to Bluetooth 4.2). While connected the longest packet length is 27 bytes. Bluetooth 4.2 defines a packet length extension allowing larger packets but far from all implementations support that.</p>		<p>The security that BLE offers is the bonding procedure. After bonding the devices have established a shared secret key which is then used to encrypt and sign all data being sent.</p>		<p>Sending normal-sized images or sounds will take several seconds since the throughput is quite low.</p>		<p>I think you should really read the Bluetooth specification or some summary to get the answer to your questions.</p>	"

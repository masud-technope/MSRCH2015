Each has Wifi, and I have a web server up and running on a bunch of them and the clocks synchronized to within a few microseconds with a local NTP server.</p>		<p>Let's say I have 10 of them and want to treat them like a big long Christmas light display.  I'd want to push data to each of them representing their portion (720 pixels) of the total display (7200 pixels).</p>		<p>The simplest way is to HTTP POST a JSON-encoded version of the data, but that feels very wrong in terms of overhead.  I'd guess a binary UDP blob is likely more appropriate.</p>		<p>What do you think is the best way to send the data to each little wifi webserver?</p>		<p>The amount of data might be something like:  </p>		<p>720 pixels x 3 bytes per pixel x 30 frames per second = 64K/sec</p>	"

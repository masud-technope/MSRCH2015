The assignment is to make a program that can simulate a parking gate via Raspberry Pi 3, so it will contain commands like printing from the usb and receiving input via button. My main programming language is java, so i'm planning to use java for the Raspberry Pi 3. 	So can Windows 10 IOT run most of the basic functions in Java?</p>	"

It looks equally bleak for other software packages.</p>		<p>Java runs just fine on the Raspberry Pi on Linux, which is the preferred OS for Raspberry anyway.</p>		<p>As for the reason, well outside of education no sane person would want to use Windows IOT it seems. With no commercial interest there is incentive for companies to provide support. And Microsoft seems to spend more money in marketing WindowsIOT then actually investing into software.</p>	"

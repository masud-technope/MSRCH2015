I was wondering if it is possible to fire the app and pass a simple parameter	Something like - </p>		<p>C:\Data\Users\administrator\Documents>IoTStartup add headed App[<em>parameter</em>]</p>		<p>and then pick up the parameter in the c# application</p>	"

But I think there is another way to satisfy your needs, you can use a configuration file saved with your parameter data, when you want to change the 	 behavior, you just need to modify the config file.So that you can use a same image.Please refer to this article(<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/app-settings/store-and-retrieve-app-data" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Store and retrieve settings and other app data</a>).</p>	"

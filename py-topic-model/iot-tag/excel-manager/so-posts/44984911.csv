But my problem begins after above steps and can't proceed to next (When agent is installed, you should update the configuration file which is usually located at "./cfg/cumulocity-config.properties" and fill the host property value. Open Cumulocity in a web browser and go to the "Registration" page. Enter the serial number that you wrote down in the previous step and click "Register Device".)

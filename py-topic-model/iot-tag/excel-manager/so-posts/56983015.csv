But when I wanted to add a registry to my project. In order to do that, it said, you need to enable the API first. I know what an API is in general sense. Is API in this context different? and why do i need to enable the API?</p>		<p>any help in this aspect is highly appreciated... Thanks in advance</p>	"

Creating a registry invokes an API call, listing registries does the same, etc. For your reference <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/reference/rest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">1</a> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/getting-started" rel="nofollow noreferrer">2</a>. With the API not enabled then you will not be able to use IoT Core or the other products.</p>	"

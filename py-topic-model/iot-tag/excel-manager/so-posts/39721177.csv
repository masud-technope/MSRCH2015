Now coming to implementation, I have gone through <strong>Apache Edgent</strong> and <strong>Kaa</strong>. Both seems to perform more or less similar job for me with respect to analytics on edge devices, but Kaa is entirely a platform for IoT which has edge analytics as a feature. Which is more efficient and used in the industry?</p>	"

But there are no mature analytic tools  like Spark to write some background jobs that perform data processing on collected information from endpoints.	In future release 1.0.0, this feature is being planned to add into Kaa platform.    </p>	"

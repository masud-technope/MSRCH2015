I've got this error (in french) :		Install-Package : Le package RabbitMQ.Client 4.1.1 n'est pas compatible avec uap10.0 (UAP,Version=v10.0). Le package RabbitMQ.Client 4.1.1 prend en charge :	- net451 (.NETFramework,Version=v4.5.1)	- netstandard1.5 (.NETStandard,Version=v1.5)		But i use .NET 4.5.1 or +. And when I'm trying to add the "RabbitMQ.Client.dll" to my project, I've got the following error :		'A reference to '...' could not be added. The project targets '.NETCore' while the file reference targets '.NETFramework'. This is not a supported scenario.'			2) The second way i'm trying to explore is to create a new "Background Application (IoT)" but i have the same errors.	</code></pre>		<p>Thanks for your help and sorry for the bad english.</p>	"

In this project, i put this code (worker.cs) : 		https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-dotnet.html		When i'm lauch it from Powershell connected to my RPi3, the .exe launch, consume one message of my queue if there is messages but stop instantly. Do you have any idea about this problem ? Thx again."

How can you explain that ? :) I have a last question, do you know if it's possible to set this .exe as a service ? If the RPi3 crash or reboot, this .exe must start automatically. Thanks again for your replies."

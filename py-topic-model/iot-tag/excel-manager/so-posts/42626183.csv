When i use the regular IO TCP node, it opens the connection right away and sits there, which is a behaviour i do not want.</p>		<p>I have tried to use some code i found on the internet but i need to require the 'net' module. I included it in the global context of settings.js on my hardware but i still can't use it. I get the following error message when i try to call new net.Socket() : "cannot read property 'socket' of undefined"</p>		<p>Please help, thank you</p>	"

Its documentation says that Content-Type should be "application/octet-stream". So i don't know how the request body should be. 	Here is a photo with an example in the documentation:</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rTvd8.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rTvd8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>Probably if i can replicate this request i could continue by my own. I've been searching a lot with no results.</p>		<p>By the way i'm using cURL. </p>	"

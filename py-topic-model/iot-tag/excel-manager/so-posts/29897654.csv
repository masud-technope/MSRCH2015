Where can I find some sample data for Overhead, and other characteristics,  for each protocol so that I compare them. I need your suggestions. You can suggest any tool to compare these protocols. </p>	"

Bear in mind, that OPC-UA shines most for SCADA systems, MQTT is very good for Publish/Subscribe messaging over unreliable networks like mobile networks.</p>		<p>If low overhead is key for you, MQTT may be a much better fit than OPC-UA.

The OPC UA PubSub extension addresses this limitation by defining a syntax for OPC UA payloads.</p>	"

Therefore it would be useful if you want to send messages between two applications developed by you.</p>		<p>OPC UA is an architecture (OPC Unified Architecture) where a communication protocol is only a part of the topics addressed. An OPC UA application is able to expose a full meshed network of Objects, Variables, Methods and data structures in an object oriented way. The communication today is based on a client/server model where the server exposes a set of standard services to navigate through the available object, read and write data, call methods or subscribe for data changes or events.</p>		<p>The main goal is to provide interoperability between applications from different vendors by defining the meta meta model on how to make information available, by defining standard services for access to the information and by defining different transport protocols and data encodings for the service invocation. Protocols include an optimized OPC UA binary protocol providing end to end security but also web services or HTTPS based protocols.</p>		<p>The OPC UA working is currently working on a second Publish Subscribe based communication model that allows a messaging between OPC UA applications. Besides a UDP based peer-to-peer protocol, this PubSub extension will also use broker based messaging protocols like AMQP and MQTT.</p>		<p>Therefore it is difficult to compare OPC UA which is a complete set of features including protocols like MQTT and MQTT as stand-alone protocol.</p>		<p>Other responses already include references to MQTT material.</p>		<p>Here are some links to OPC UA material:</p>		<p>Brochure with some high level introduction to OPC UA:	<a href="https://opcfoundation.org/resources/brochures/" rel="noreferrer">https://opcfoundation.org/resources/brochures/</a></p>		<p>OPC UA Specifications:	<a href="https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/specifications-unified-architecture" rel="noreferrer">https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/specifications-unified-architecture</a></p>		<p>Free evaluation and test tools:</p>		<p>Test / demo client:	<a href="https://www.unified-automation.com/downloads/opc-ua-clients.html" rel="noreferrer">https://www.unified-automation.com/downloads/opc-ua-clients.html</a></p>		<p>Test / demo servers:	<a href="https://www.unified-automation.com/downloads/opc-ua-servers.html" rel="noreferrer">https://www.unified-automation.com/downloads/opc-ua-servers.html</a></p>		<p>Development tools for different programming languages:	<a href="https://www.unified-automation.com/downloads/opc-ua-development.html" rel="noreferrer">https://www.unified-automation.com/downloads/opc-ua-development.html</a></p>	"

I have this line of code:</p>		<pre><code>MqttClient Client = new MqttClient(Broker, ClientId, Persistence);	</code></pre>		<p>But shows an <strong>"Unhandled exception"</strong> error. So I fixed it by enclosing it with a try/catch.</p>		<pre><code> try {	        MqttClient Client = new MqttClient(Broker, ClientId, Persistence);	    } catch (MqttException e) {	        e.printStackTrace();	    }	</code></pre>		<p>It actually works but can't understand why the need of this. Thanks in advance.</p>	"

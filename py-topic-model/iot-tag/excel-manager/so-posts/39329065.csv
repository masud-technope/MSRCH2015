I am sequentially sending R B G values in loop through Arduino but it always misses the middle one. It sends R but after that goes G value than now its time for R but this time B is sent. There was an answer to a related question that suggests a workaround with changing stop function PubNub.cpp instead of waiting for a return message it directly stops the client but it didn't solve my problem either.How can i fix this situation?

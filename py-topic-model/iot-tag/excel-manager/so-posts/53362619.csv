Now any time I hit the button I get a blinking red light: long-short-short pattern.</p>		<p>Amazon defines this error: "Cannot establish a secure connection with the server. This error is most likely due to an unknown or inactive certificate."</p>		<p>I generated a new certificate and verified this connects me successfully:</p>		<pre><code>openssl s_client -connect &lt;button-id-here&gt;.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:8443 -CAfile AmazonRootCA1.pem -cert certificate.pem.crt -key private.pem.key 	</code></pre>		<p>But uploading the same certificate and private key to the button doesn't make the error go away. I still get long-short-short blinking.</p>		<p>What else can I do to troubleshoot this? What else could suddenly cause this error?</p>		<p>This is on my very simple home network where I have not made any changes. </p>	"

The problem then cleared up on its own, without me issuing a new cert. So, the only resolution really is to open a support case, apparently.</p>	"

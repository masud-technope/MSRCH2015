At most the storage should equate to the topic string that the client subscribes to, this will be matched against a incoming message to see if it should be delivered.</p>		<p>Where this may not hold true is with persistent subscriptions (where the clean session value is not set to true). In this case if a client disconnects then messages may be queued until it reconnects. The amount of memory consumed here will be a function of the number of messages and their size (plus what discard policy the broker may have) and not directly a function of the number of subscribed topics.</p>		<p>To answer the second part of your question, subscribing to 10,000,000 topics using the wildcard is not likely to cause a memory leak, but it may very well flood the client depending on how often messages are published on those topics.</p>	"

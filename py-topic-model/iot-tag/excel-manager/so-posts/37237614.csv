The cc2650 android app uses MqttAndroidClient to connect to MQTT server provided by bluemix. The problem I am facing after sometime (around 7 mins) it get timedout.</p>		<p>Following exception is visible on the android studio console	<em>d:2f7tpk:ti-sensortag2:B0B448C07886: Timed out as no activity, keepAlive=240,000 lastOutboundActivity=1,463,309,545,312 lastInboundActivity=1,463,309,275,609 time=1,463,309,785,352 lastPing=1,463,309,545,312</em></p>		<p>Please note that every 10 seconds I am publishing the data to server from my android client app. So not sure why it is saying no activity.	Keepalive interval is set to 120 seconds.</p>		<p>I confirmed it. It is IBM Bluemix which is disconnecting the client after approx 7 min. During this period client was continuously sending the data in 10 sec interval and that was also visible on the Bluemix device page.</p>		<p>Any idea why Bluemix is disconnecting it after 6-7 minutes (It is not fixed but out of 6 in 5 it got disconnected in 7 min and once it was around 6 min).</p>		<p>New observation:	The other observation is once it is disconnected then it takes 10-12 retries before I am able to reconnect to Bluemix server. From Mqttv3 client I get the exception "Unable to connect to server". But during this period I am able to ping to server through cmdline ping utility.</p>	"

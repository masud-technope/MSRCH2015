My app is running as default and I am using it for remote control of electronic devices. When the IoT is updating, app is not working and I need to have my app avalaible 24/7. Do you know how to do it?</p>	"

39656147,66827574,39656147,3,1,Thu Sep 29 09:30:00 EDT 2016,134204,"Then don't use Insider builds. Data costs doesn't mean you should allow the device to be hacked. You'll pay a *lot* more if that happens. Did you encounter a real problem or did you assume that stable versions will receive large updates?"

Just last week hacked IoT devices were used to launch a 620 GBps attack. Updates are the **ONLY** security measure available for IoT devices. You can't run firewalls, antivirus programs or install patches on an IoT device"

Both is done by PS script that is on this <a href="https://brosteins.com/2016/09/06/disable-windows-update-windows-10-iot-core-powershell/" rel="nofollow">website</a> </p>	"

On the one hand, IoT devices are too weak to run firewalls, antiviruses or even use HTTPS. Updates are the *only* defense measure all of them can use. On the other hand, no matter what you do, that network will *NOT* be as isolated as you think. Your own laptop will have access to it for example. Remember Stuxnet. On the other hand you said "network". Even if you mean a wired network, it *won't* be isolated. All it would take would be to attach another computer to an Ethernet port"
39656147,95987989,39657068,3,0,Fri Feb 08 15:50:00 EST 2019,6002700,"@PanagiotisKanavos the device would not have any access to the Internet as it is intended for deployment into a secure computing environment, so the monitoring and control machines are also on the same, isolated network (without access to the Internet). Yes, if other machines on the network were compromised the device could be compromised, but that posits there secure computing environment has already failed."
39656147,95988176,39657068,3,0,Fri Feb 08 15:56:00 EST 2019,134204,"@FluxIX how does that affect anything? Business networks don't update Windows machines over the Internet, they use Update servers. Servers deployed on DNZs still get updated, in fact they get security fixes sooner than others. Even if you think you don't need to worry about security, you still need to update and deploy your own software. Will you go to each individual machine with a USB stick? This isn't a "Yes but". It's an actual restriction of the IoT domain, no matter the deployment environment."
39656147,95937155,39657068,3,0,Thu Feb 07 09:03:00 EST 2019,134204,"@FluxIX this is no joke by the way. I suggest you take the reputable IoT courses on Coursera or edX and check the security-related parts. The restrictions are rather sobering. Updates may be the *only* defence you have against hacking. Yes it's hard, yes disconnections, but that's why IoT isn't trivial and why the big cloud providers offer command, control, monitoring suites for them."

I am looking at making a device which communicates on an isolated network with no access to the Internet, so an update from an external network is impossible."

I have an app which that is running as default app and I would like to have powershell script to update it when the new version will be avalaible. I have only found this script. The best way for me is that I will develop new app and on RPi 3 I will have timer to check for version update than the app will download it and script will update the app. I have only found <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ocarpen/2012/08/14/scripts-to-install-update-or-uninstall-a-sharepoint-2013-app-with-powershell/" rel="nofollow">this</a> and I do not know how to modify it. Could you please help me?</p>	"

The only interface RTI provide to integrate is webhook. I have to call the API, be it cloudant or my own. If you mean I should write a API just to parse the message before sending it to cloudant, I see it defeating the purpose of quick implementation of any application. RTI should be able to send right JSON to the POST API irrespective of the consumer."

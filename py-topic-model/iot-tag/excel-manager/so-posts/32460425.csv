But when I click on the portal add a device, it asks for device types on creating new one I am still not able to add the device. Has the device adding process changed in new IBM Bluemix portal because none of the recipes defines it. Please provide the latest steps if someone has.</p>	"

Now if you want to add a device and don't already have a raspberry pi device type defined just click "add device" 	then "create device type"  and add the info to define your device.  Note that the metadata field is optional.  </p>		<p>Once you have gone through the steps to add "device type", that type will then be available to select when you add device and you can choose it as the type to add, then click next and the screen will have a place to add device ID.<br>	I am adding a few screen shots for reference. 	<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o3z04.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o3z04.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KBM09.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KBM09.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vIOEj.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vIOEj.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9FX2q.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9FX2q.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3F8Ns.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3F8Ns.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>	"

It may even be printed on the outside of your pi.   Here are some examples for ways to obtain it programmatically:  http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/06/finding-the-mac-address-of-a-raspberry-pi/                     https://github.com/ibm-messaging/iot-raspberrypi/blob/master/samples/c/iotGetDeviceID.sh"

You should be able to follow these steps:  1. Click Add Device  2. click Create Device Type  3.  Enter Name and Description  4. continue through steps until that device ID type is created and then on the next screen it will allow you to input device ID"

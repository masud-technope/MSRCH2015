I want to send instructions to it from smartphone which is connected to the same network from App.	How can this be achieved? What are my options?</p>		<p>In my case it is esp8266 node that automatically connects to local network.</p>	"

So all your request gonna be made via this coordinator. You need to run a server to handle connections in the coordinator.</p></li>	</ol>		<p>If you want to use internet access, here is fourth possibility:</p>		<ol start="4">	<li>Use a host on cloud/internet: Use a host or a cloud instance as communicator and bridge the app and the device to the host via WebSocket or RESTFul servers. You gonna use your host IP for all request and the server gonna handle connections.</li>	</ol>	"

I am a total newbie on cloud development. Can someone tell me some good books/links on Azure that will help me understand how I can use Azure for IoT and start development on the same.?</p>		<p>Thanks a lot for your inputs.</p>	"

You can use SAAS components for rapid prototyping, parts or all of your application architecture. This will give you a better insight into selecting the appropriate stack of tools for your application. </p>		<p>If you want to deploy your own software stack, you would provision Azure Virtual Machines. Azure provides an SDK to interact with the cloud infrastructure. </p>		<p>Docker is a really good option to use for application deployment these days. Google provides better support for Docker containers using its Kubernetes framework.</p>		<p>Simple APIs or website can be developed on azure using Azure webapps. I am currently developing a node application using azure websites. The actual container where the site runs is a windows NT machine with IIS. If you want your SAAS server container's to be linux based then you might look at AWS/Google or Redhat Openshift.</p>		<p>I have used OpenShift SAAS, and found it quite easy to get onboard with.</p>	"

You can definitely have a look at the following white paper: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/1/F/E1FFDADF-C0FF-4E72-A834-B173A079F393/Microsoft_Internet_of_Things_White_Paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/1/F/E1FFDADF-C0FF-4E72-A834-B173A079F393/Microsoft_Internet_of_Things_White_Paper.pdf</a></p>		<p>The most important services for IoT in Azure are (until today):</p>		<ul>	<li>Azure Event Hubs: a massive ingestion service that can take in millions of telemetry events per second.</li>	<li>Azure Stream Analytics: Real time complex event processing, combining multiple incoming streams of data and detection patterns in it</li>	<li>PowerBI: this will allow users to build and explore interactive reports and graphs</li>	<li>Azure Machine Learning: Leverage prediction &amp; machine learning models</li>	<li>For storage, you have DocumentDB, Azure and blob storage, among other</li>	<li>HDInsight will help you in working with the data (big data) and make jobs with it.</li>	<li>Azure Web Apps and API apps will allow you to present and expose the data to you users and custom reports</li>	</ul>		<p>Good luck</p>	"

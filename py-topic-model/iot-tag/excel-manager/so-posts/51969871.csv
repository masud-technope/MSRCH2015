While trying to understand the code behind this, I have come across a function:</p>		<pre><code>void callback(char* topic, byte* payload, unsigned int length) {	}	</code></pre>		<p>So, my question is, what exactly is this function used for in MQTT? If someone explains to me or links a tutorial that will be useful. Thanks in advance! </p>	"

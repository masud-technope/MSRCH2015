And I noticed I can connect a device to IoT hub using either Primary key or Secondary key. </p>		<p>So, what's the purpose to have Primary/Secondary keys? How should I design the use of both keys?</p>	"

First of all it would allow you to keep using your service when you want to replace your key. Say you connect all your services using the primary and you want to refresh it. You could use the secondary temporarily in your services and then change your primary without having downtime. After you do the change you can configure your services to use the new Primary key.</p>		<p>The second possibility would be that you give partners your secondary key and you use your primary if one of your partners would abuse the key you could replace it without having downtime in your own services.</p>	"

If there are very limited clients (or devices), it will be OK to manually re-generated and re-deploy the keys in devices. However, if there are numerous devices, and I want set the policy to periodically update the keys on devices, any suggested solution to automatically renew the keys and deploy them in devices?"

This seems to be a good starting point on securing your IOT story: http://robtiffany.com/getting-started-with-azure-iot-services-securing-event-hub-telemetry-with-sas-tokens/		The primary/secondary key is a better solution for websites using azure storage for example where you only have 1 or 2 applications using it and where you have better control."

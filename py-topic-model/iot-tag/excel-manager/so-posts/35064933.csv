I've been able to get a few of the samples to work, even got an led on a breadboard to be controllable through a nodejs server.	I am using the latest chakra core files and have all of the packages installed on my dev machine, which is pretty clean.</p>		<p>I am guessing its not able to install the packages that are specified in the packages.json file, here is the excerpt:</p>		<p>"express": "~4.0.0",	"morgan": "~1.0.0",	"mongoose": "~3.6.13",	"body-parser": "~1.0.1"</p>		<p>If it is the packages, how does one go about deploying nodejs applications with packages to windows iot? I considered just copying the application to the iot device and starting it manually, no luck. I also need the ms assemblies that allow me to interface code with the gpio.</p>		<p>I am now trying to get a simple rest api to windows 10 iot, and am having some trouble. I followed this <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>, and its working if I use the non Universal Windows template on my machine. However, when I try to use this template (Basic Node.js Express 4 Application (Universal Windows)), and make it into the same application, the app is deployed, but the debugger fails, looking at the debug section of the windows 10 iot device, I have the following:	Report signature</p>		<p>Package Full Name : test.iot.nodejs.express.njsproj_1.0.0.0_arm__b4gtp05xzgr10	Application Name : praid:App	Application Version : 10.0.10586.63	Application Timestamp : 568b3d9f	Fault Module Name : ucrtbase.dll	Fault Module Version : 10.0.10586.63	Fault Module Timestamp : 568b34eb	Exception Offset : 000351ed	Exception Code : c0000409	Exception Data : 00000005	EventTime</p>		<p>January 26, 2016 at 10:22:17 PM PST</p>		<p>Link to Watson bucket</p>		<p>133280376927	FriendlyEventName</p>		<p>Stopped working</p>		<p>AppName</p>		<p>test.iot.nodejs.express.njsproj_b4gtp05xzgr10!App</p>		<p>AppPath</p>		<p>C:\windows\system32\backgroundTaskHost.exe</p>	"

35064933,57854625,35064933,3,1,Thu Jan 28 15:41:00 EST 2016,1597656,"You can take a look at this article https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/05/12/bringing-node-js-to-windows-10-iot-core/ 	I am no expert in windows OS, but I would refrain from using nodejs on iot, given that the support is still limited and probably will stay limited"

It would be nice to have one IoT Registry for each product/application, but it seems AWS IoT Registry is unique. For each application there will be hunderds of devices.</p>		<p>The only solution I found is to create a Thing name with an application-dependent prefix: "Product1_id1", "Product1_id2",... "Product2_id1", "Product2_id", ...</p>		<p>Another solution is to create a different AWS account for each application.</p>		<p>It's a very pity AWS doesn't let you create different projects with a separate Registry.</p>	"

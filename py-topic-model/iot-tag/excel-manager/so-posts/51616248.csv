As I understand well it's produced by Texas Instruments, but unfortunately any app I've tried (Even SensorTag both on iOS and Android) to edit iBeacon tags failed, no one seems to be able to allow me change UUID, Major and Minor.</p>		<p>I hope that someone could help me to understand better in which situation I am. Phisically the beacon is just the CC2541 board (<a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Turn-your-CC2541-based-HM-10-Bluetooth-Smart-Modul/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.instructables.com/id/Turn-your-CC2541-based-HM-10-Bluetooth-Smart-Modul/</a>) with a module to attach a button battery.</p>	"

From that point you may be able to use a terminal program to set the identifiers if the CC2541 has base firmware.  </p>		<p>If your CC2541 does not have base firmware, you'll need an additional  jig that allows you to flash new firmware so you can get the identifiers configured.</p>		<p>If you are just using these devices because they are convenient, it would be far easier to order new off-the-shelf beacons that are configurable.  If you actually do want to learn to use this hardware, I'd suggest getting a development setup going through tutorials like you have linked above.</p>	"

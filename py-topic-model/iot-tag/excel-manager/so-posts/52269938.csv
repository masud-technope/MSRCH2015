What I want to know is that how <strong>xiaomi2mqtt</strong> is connected to the actual hardware device (Aquara) over the Internet? In another world, I don't understand this part of the documentation:</p>		<pre><code>//Device list:		{	  "device_id": "Nice name",	  "158d000aaa2888": "Bedroom window",	  "158d000aaa5b35": "Frontdoor",	  "gateways": {	    "gateway_id": "password"	  }	}	</code></pre>		<blockquote>	  <p>"158d000aaa2888", "158d000aaa5b35, "gateway_id", "password"</p>	</blockquote>		<p>What are these? Where do they from ? What are they used for?   </p>	"

This is what is used by the xiaomi2mqtt app. How to enable it, is documented on the wiki, <a href="https://github.com/svrooij/node-xiaomi2mqtt/wiki/Network-mode-iOS" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/svrooij/node-xiaomi2mqtt/wiki/Network-mode-iOS</a></p>		<p>It works like this</p>		<p><code>Gateway -&gt; Wifi -&gt; Chinese cloud api -&gt; MiHome app</code></p>		<p>but the xiaomi2mqtt app uses the following:</p>		<p><code>Gateway (with local mode enabled) -&gt; Wifi (multicast messages) -&gt; xiaomi2mqtt (running on device on same network).</code></p>		<p>Ps. posting stuff in closed  unrelated issues, doesn't really help...</p>	"

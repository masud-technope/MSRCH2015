E.g., the following topology </p>		<pre><code>7-6-5-1-2-3-4 	  | |     |	  8 10    9	</code></pre>		<p>If the node No 1 wants to send a msg to node 7, it will send it to 5 without knowing where exactly No 7 is. Node No 5 will send it to No 6 who knows that it is "directly" connected to 7.	On the other hand, if No 1 wants to send a msg to No 4, it will send it to No 2, who knows that No 4 is accessible via No 3.</p>	"

I have two PCF8591 AD/DA converter modules, and when I connect them to the RPi using the SCL and SDA ports, they are detected and shown by "sudo i2cdetect -y 1". But the arduinos do not show up. This is How I have connected the RPi and the Arduino Minis:</p>		<p><strong>RPi         -> Arduino</strong></p>		<p>3.3V        -> Vin</p>		<p>GND         -> GND</p>		<p>SDA(GPIO2)  -> SDA(A4)</p>		<p>SCL(GPIO3)  -> SCL(A5)</p>		<p>I would like to know what is going wrong here. Please suggest.</p>	"

43797706,74641601,43797706,3,0,Fri May 05 09:16:00 EDT 2017,6766333,"Yes, I too realised this a little too late that there no difference between the RPi(master) and the Arduinos(slave) in this circuit. The Arduinos need to be configured to be used as slaves. I am studying about that, will say when I find out how this is done."

I tried uploading the sketch to UNOs, and the upload was successful. Now when I have configured the two UNOs using two different addresses, they show up on i2cdetect."

I have opened a new thread about the problems regarding my Mini Arduinos here:	https://www.experts-exchange.com/questions/29020889/Problem-uploading-sketch-and-burning-bootloader-to-Arduino-Pro-Mini.html		Please go through it and help me out if possible."

Below is my query in azure portal.</p>		<p>So far this is my query as simple as this:</p>		<pre><code>SELECT	    *	INTO	    [mystorage]	FROM	    [iothubin]	WHERE  Properties.type = "type1"	</code></pre>		<p>I also tried to call out the key without its parent (such as: where type = "") with no results as well. </p>		<p>I am sure that i am sending messages with this custom property in the header since i can view it using device explorer tool.</p>		<p>any idea how to get this working?</p>	"

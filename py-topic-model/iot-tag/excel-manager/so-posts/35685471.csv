Just as a reminder: GPIO0 must be pulled high or floating for non-flash boot, see http://j.mp/1QnScQo. Did you try with tools other than ESPlorer (see http://j.mp/1TMBqQw for selection)? I doubt it's got anything to do with the problem but _do not_ use those old pre-built binaries. The current master/dev branch are now at 1.4/1.5.1 respectively and anything older is no longer supported. Build the firmware yourself: http://j.mp/1TMBAaC."

35685471,59093058,35685471,3,1,Mon Feb 29 19:43:00 EST 2016,131929,"Lua scripts are not "flashed" they're "uploaded", it's important to not mix the two. What startup message do you get (update your question)? And what happens if you upload a Lua script?"

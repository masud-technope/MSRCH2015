Seems on the select you are hitting cache 19,999 times, on write your inserts get bundled into writes. On EBS single write operations can be rather large. Read more about it <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-io-characteristics.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>IOPS are a unit of measure representing input/output operations per second. The operations are measured in KiB, and the underlying drive technology determines the maximum amount of data that a volume type counts as a single I/O. I/O size is capped at 256 KiB for SSD volumes and 1,024 KiB for HDD volumes</p>	</blockquote>	"

For example select * from checking where number = 1;    select * from checking where number = 2;  select * from checking where number = 3; etc.,  I am looping till 20000. Even then I am getting only 1 read operation (count/sec). Someone please explain!"

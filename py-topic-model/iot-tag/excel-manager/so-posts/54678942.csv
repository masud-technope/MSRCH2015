I would like to add the capability of displaying a live video feed from a iPhone camera or webcam, and I'm wondering if anyone here knows if ThingsBoard supports any sort of video data stream (either live or timed screen capture based)?</p>		<p>Ideally, I'd like to mount the phone/camera to a servo-controlled mount which I can used to position the camera using controls on the dashboard.</p>	"

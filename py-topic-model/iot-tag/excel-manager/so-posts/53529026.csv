I completed up to the step 'Try out the virtual fire alarm -> Action -> View device details' 	in the link '<a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/IOTS330/Enterprise+IoT+solution#7e9295d0766f43019567911516cbf83e" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.wso2.com/display/IOTS330/Enterprise+IoT+solution#7e9295d0766f43019567911516cbf83e</a>'. But, the real-time data was not displayed so that, temperature readings under device statistics in the graph at the server page is empty.</p>		<p>There were exceptions and error messages displayed on analytics.bat, broker.bat and virtual fire alarm start-device.bat. Also, in the Fire Alarm Emulator, the connection status is displayed as 'Not-Registered'. I did log-in to the DAS (Data Analytics Server) and just added some permissions for my account. I'm not aware what should be done at DAS clearly.</p>		<p>So, are there some settings/registration to be done at DAS? Or is this a bug in WSO2 IoT server? If so, how to resolve it? Please give me some insight on this. I have attached the relevant screenshots below. Thank you.</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cetTW.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Exception at analytics.bat</a></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sSxaQ.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Error message at broker.bat</a></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WGEJl.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Error message at Virtual Fire Alarm start-device.bat</a></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vnlm2.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Fire Alarm Emulator screenshot</a></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Haaf7.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Device details at server page</a></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GyIMp.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Data Analytics Server</a></p>	"

I use WSO2 IoT server and I am not able to access WSO2 IoT server device Management Console (<a href="https://localhost:9443/devicemgt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://localhost:9443/devicemgt</a>) when I input 'admin' both username and password or input this which created a new account.<br>	As a result, it showed me the Authentication failed. When I saw users list in <a href="https://localhost:9443/carbon" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://localhost:9443/carbon</a>, it showed admin, new accounts .... etc. 	I don't know why it does not log in  WSO2 IoT server device Management Console.	Please give your advice and then thank you so much. </p>	"

If you cannot change java version then you need to change the <code>compression parameter to off</code> in <code>catalina-server.xml</code> file </p>	"

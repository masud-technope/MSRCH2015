The first step is to initiate a WebSocket connection by making a GET request to an endpoint created by following the steps in the tutorial but I'm getting this error:</p>		<p><code>XMLHttpRequest cannot load &lt;my endpoint&gt; Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource.</code></p>		<p>I was wondering if anyone has encountered this error and if so, how they resolved it? </p>		<p>Here's a link to the code <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-aws-iot/blob/2c8035728ec8228e296580c8714f3f7ace870fbe/src/js/components/App.js">https://github.com/dwyl/learn-aws-iot/blob/2c8035728ec8228e296580c8714f3f7ace870fbe/src/js/components/App.js</a></p>	"

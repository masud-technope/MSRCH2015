However, when trying to visualize the data on a dashboard it shows up as "Not available". Is there anything in addition to the schema definition that I need to do in order for a Virtual Data Point to work?</p>	"

The easiest way forward is probably if someone could supply a working example of how to create virtual data points and use them in a dashboard."

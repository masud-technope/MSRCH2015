The message doesnt pass this method and it throws an error. I might think im sending an incorrent DeviceID due to serviceID for being misonfigure with DeviceID on my IOTHub. Am i wrong to say so why on my object declaration ServiceClient serviceClient = new ......  rather be DeviceClient s_deviceClient = new DeviceClient();"

They have Bluetooth classes available, however it seems that I would have to pick between either running 1) Bluetooth Classic 2.1 OR 2) BLE</p>		<p>The classes and docs are here: <a href="http://labs.mediatek.com/site/znch/developer_tools/mediatek_linkit/api_references/Lib_Bluetooth.gsp" rel="nofollow">http://labs.mediatek.com/site/znch/developer_tools/mediatek_linkit/api_references/Lib_Bluetooth.gsp</a></p>		<p>We basically want to make our device compatible with as many Smart phones as possible so I wonder whether it possible to have a device that is a peripheral to listen to both, BLE and Bluetooth Classic Connections at the same time. Then if it gets connected to via either, stop broadcasting the other?</p>		<p>The only technical way seems to have maybe a dip switch on the iot device that sets the mode and it uses BLE code base or Classic code base based on the position of the dip switch. That does not seem very elegant to me.</p>		<p>Lastly, I wonder if my question even makes sense. I searched around for hours and I cannot seem to find anybody else that is doing this, so I wonder if most people are just going with BLE these days and just don't care about about Classic BR/EDR anymore. 	Any help would be much appreciated. </p>	"

And I don't think there's any smartphone out there that has BLE but doesn't have BR/EDR.  It's probably far simpler to just use BR/EDR.  Also, the whole point to BLE is battery savings and you'll lose that if you're also running BR/EDR, right?  However, there are methods to access GATT over BR/EDR if you wanted to allow either transport."

The Bluetooth 2.1 and Bluetooth GATT (4.0) on LinkIt ONE platform run independently. Currently, the <a href="https://labs.mediatek.com/site/global/developer_tools/mediatek_linkit/whatis_linkit/index.gsp" rel="nofollow">LinkIt ONE platform</a> supports <a href="https://labs.mediatek.com/site/global/developer_tools/mediatek_linkit/api_references/LBTClientClass.gsp" rel="nofollow">SPP (2.1)</a> and <a href="https://labs.mediatek.com/site/global/developer_tools/mediatek_linkit/api_references/LGATTClient.gsp" rel="nofollow">GATT (4.0)</a> profiles. You can start to try both the <a href="https://labs.mediatek.com/site/global/developer_tools/mediatek_linkit/api_references/Lib_Bluetooth.gsp" rel="nofollow">SPP and GATT</a> at the same time on the board, by instantiating the objects of BT Basic and BLE separately.</p>	"

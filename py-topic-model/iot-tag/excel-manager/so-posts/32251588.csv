I have a issue with reconnecting the BLE node to my SBC after disconnecting the BLE node.</p>		<p>case: I always have to scan using <code>$sudo hcitool lescan</code> and then run my bluepy python app to request data over BLE.	At this point of time I can disconnect the BLE node and reconnect it within say 15 seconds. but if I wait any longer, I again have to run lescan cmd and then run my bluepy app to connect and communicate.	I just want to eliminate the scanning part everytime before i run blupy app. 	May I know what exactly happens when I execute <code>lescan</code> cmd after which the bluepy app starts communicating with my ble node?</p>		<p>I presumed that the lescan cmd will switch the dongle to ble mode and tried to keep ble mode as default by setting flags using<br>	<code>sudo hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0008 1e 02 01 16 1a</code>  (changing 1a to 16 as per thread <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30966837/how-to-set-bluez-mode">How to set bluez mode?</a>)</p>		<p>All I want is to run the blupy app with the ble device mac ID and start communicating without the need to lescan.</p>		<p>Thanks in advance </p>	"

The below script is to simulate the <code>hcitool lescan</code> command.

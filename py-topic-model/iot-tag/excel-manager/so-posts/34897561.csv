What could be the problem?	The next step will be to connect and publish to my own Bluemix IoT service, but if I can't send messages to the demo, I can't hope for more.</p>		<p>UPDATE:	If I connect, and publish, the quickstart app shows that I'm disconnected, but the client still lets me publish for about 3 secs, after that I get an exception: 32104 (the client is not connected).</p>	"

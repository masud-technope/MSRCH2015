How long should it be able to work independently (battery).   what in case of no access to internet, mobile network (big disasters).  how diverse or all the systems to connect to.  are they almost alike and is interfacing easy (just plain audio output)   or do you need to look into every type to get it working.  who is going to test it from time to time to see if it actually works.  how well can these things be protected of misuse etc etc.... very interesting challenge."

For this reason, I want to hide my code for saving my work being concluded in span of last 6 months from getting public in few minutes. Any other way or hint will be appreciated for doing same.</p>	"

Someone willing to pay a good RE team can *always* get your code out; getting the expertise needed to refine that code is more expensive, and a bunch of code without a team of people who understand the algorithms is useless."

There's way more to running a software business than just having posession of the source."

Send your Arduino data to the server and then write the data to Cloud Firestore.	To find how to write data into Firestore, refer this documentation: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data</a> and chose the integration for your server. Firestore supports most of the popular server integrations like Node.js, GO, PHP, Python etc.</p>	"

Currently I am syncing these images to my personal Google Drive account. This way I can watch the latest picture on my smartphone.</p>		<p>I am wondering if there is a ready-to-use web service (provided by some company) that allows me to upload images/videos and to see them using a ready-to-use app for my smartphone without using the more generic Google Drive app. Can you recommend a service? Thanks in advance.</p>	"

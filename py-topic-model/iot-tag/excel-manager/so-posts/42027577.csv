A device can send <strong>events</strong> and receive <strong>commands</strong>. It can't receive <strong>events</strong>.  To do this you need to connect as an application.  You will <code>import ibmiotf.application</code> and have something like: </p>		<pre><code>options = ibmiotf.application.ParseConfigFile(configFilePath)	appClient = ibmiotf.application.Client(options)		appClient.connect()	appClient.subscribeToDeviceEvents()	</code></pre>		<p>The config file should be like:</p>		<pre><code>[application]	org=orgId	id=myApplication	auth-method=apikey	auth-key=key	auth-token=token	</code></pre>		<p>Where the auth-key/auth-token comes from the Apps part of your platform. You'll have to generate a set to connect as an application.  The auth-method should be left as apikey. </p>		<p>That will list every event that arrives to your platform.  You can make it more granular.

I also understand that each layer communicate with the other layer of the end computer where a communication start from the top to down from the sender and then down to top in the receiver and at each layer a connections or a communication is established in the other layer. But the problem I am facing is that how the internet of things protocols communicates with each other? I need a deep understand of this concept where in the internet there is only few resources about this topic.  </p>	"

For example, you could connect a motion sensor to the device and have the device generate an event whenever motion is detected.</p>		<pre><code>Particle.subscribe()	</code></pre>		<p>Subscribe to events published by devices.This allows devices to talk to each other very easily. For example, one device could publish events when a motion sensor is triggered and another could subscribe to these events and respond by sounding an alarm.</p>		<p>To use Particle.subscribe(), define a handler function and register it in setup().</p>		<p>References:</p>		<p><a href="https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/#cloud-functions" rel="nofollow">https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/#cloud-functions</a></p>	"

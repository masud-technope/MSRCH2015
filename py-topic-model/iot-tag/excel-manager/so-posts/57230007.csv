You should really try to keep the task of the Arduino to something like a very minimal RESTful API, and ideally use something simpler like a serial interface.  If you really want to put an embedded board on a network, chose instead something *designed* for that like an ESP8266 or something with an operating system like a router chip turned IoT board."

57230007,100964438,57230038,3,0,Sat Jul 27 08:46:00 EDT 2019,954158,"Once you create the web server, you can make calls to it using GET or POST http requests and it will fetch you the response from the web server. For C based example look at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/GSMExamplesWebClient . For javascript, check http methods - https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp . For a more elaborate solution using Javascript to communicate to arduino, see the link https://startingelectronics.org/tutorials/arduino/ethernet-shield-web-server-tutorial/web-server-read-switch-using-AJAX/ . You will have to adapt it to use GSMServer instead of ethernet shield"

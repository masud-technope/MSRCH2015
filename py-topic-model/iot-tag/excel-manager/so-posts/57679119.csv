A digital sensor and IO pin can only give 0 or 1 input which is 0V or 3/5V which you are presently using.	 For the requirement you specified, the sensor and IO must be of analog type which gives varying 0-3/5V based on the moisture level. Go through the sensor spec and find out whether analog output it can give then program for the same.	From the link you shared it seems the sensor output is digital(DO) which is not suitable for your requirement. Find a sensor from market which can give AO(analog output).</p>	"

But I am not sure about how to make it work using Raspberry-Pi and I don't know about the changes to be made in this code in order to get the exact values"

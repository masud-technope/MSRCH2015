However part of the process of finding the local IP of the device requires scanning the local network which seems to essentially DDoS the PIC offline; causing it to get hung somewhere and having to be reset by the watchdog. I haven't been able to find much online regarding this issue and I'm still troubleshooting it. Does anybody have experience with this or know a good place to start looking at a way of preventing this? </p>	"

Consider someone might have a wifi network with an SSID that breaks assumptions and causes a crash so if possible go somewhere remote or shielded.  Check the codebase repository for related known issues."

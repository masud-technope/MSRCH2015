The runicast primitive	   uses the packet ID attribute as a sequence number for matching	   acknowledgement packets to the corresponding data packets.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>but I didn't understand how to do it in practice.

Enough to demultiplex the ACK in most cases, but may be insufficient for your purposes. (The packet ID size in bits can be changed by redefining <code>RUNICAST_PACKET_ID_BITS</code>.)</p>		<p>Also Rime is obsolete. Don't use it in your code, especially production code unless you know what you're doing. <code>runicast</code> was never one of the highlights of Rime, I doubt there are no better alternatives (e.g. the uIPv6 stack) for what you want to do.</p>	"

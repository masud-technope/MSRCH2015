When I try a ARM build on the PI3 (remote), everything appears to work, but the serial data read never returns. No timeout, nothing. On the desktop, it starts getting GPS data from the chip right away. I also tried the CustomSerial sample app and am getting the same result. I do have the manifest updated to show serial port access, so don't think that is the problem.</p>		<p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>	"

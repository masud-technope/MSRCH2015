We were planing on using anomaly function built into stream analytics in  azure  for accomplishing this task.</p>		<p>When I'm running anomaly function in stream analytics query as follows </p>		<pre><code>SELECT    ANOMALYDETECTION(BATTERYVOLTAGE)  OVER( LIMIT DURATION(hour, 1)) 	as anomaly   FROM [IotTelemetryStream]	</code></pre>		<p>it is returning the following error message:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>unexpected error has occurred. Please open a support ticket to investigate and provide the following client request id:_______</p>	</blockquote>		<p>But when running the same query after removing anomaly function  works fine.</p>		<pre><code>SELECT   BATTERYVOLTAGE as anomaly   FROM [IotTelemetryStream]	</code></pre>		<p>I cannot find any reference for this issue any where on web so any help would be much appreciated and thanks in advance.</p>	"

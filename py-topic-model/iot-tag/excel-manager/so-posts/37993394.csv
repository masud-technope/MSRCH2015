I can't recall the exact byte order (it think it's LE), so your line of code would look like either:</p>		<pre><code>characteristic.setValue(new byte[] {(byte)0x7F, (byte)0x00});	</code></pre>		<p>or</p>		<pre><code>characteristic.setValue(new byte[] {(byte)0x00, (byte)0x7F});	</code></pre>		<p>EDIT: I Can confirm it's the first option after reviewing TI's User Guide</p>	"

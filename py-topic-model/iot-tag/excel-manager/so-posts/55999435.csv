The reference of the code is from <a href="https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-based-accident-alert-system-using-gps-gsm-accelerometer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-based-accident-alert-system-using-gps-gsm-accelerometer</a>	but have made few changes of my own but not in the programming for the gps module.</p>	"

You are adding the value of a character to a string pointer.</p>		<p>You should create a buffer with a maximum length, insert a char and check buffer overflow.</p>		<p>Also <code>i</code> seems not be defined. And in C is very bad practice to use global variables as you are doing. Keep one <code>i</code> in the function. Check again the string length.</p>		<p>In general, it seems you are using a language you do not know enough to write simple programs (string manipulation is basic on C). Either learn better C or look for a python implementation (or just link) of the gps library.</p>	"

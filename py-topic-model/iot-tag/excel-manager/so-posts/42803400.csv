When you send a request from some client (e.g. browser) that client connects to this server in some way through a proxy or directly. The device doesn't care from where the request was sent. It just sends a HTTP OK back to wherever the request came from. Side note: this isn't a very good example of how to initialise a NodeMCU application, see http://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/en/upload/#initlua for a better template."

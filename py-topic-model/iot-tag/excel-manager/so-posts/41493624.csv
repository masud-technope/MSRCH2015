This provisioned multiple services on my Azure account, which have dramatically increased the compute costs. The image shows all that have been provisioned for the suite:<p> <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rzTuc.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rzTuc.png" alt="enter image description here"></a> <p> All of these services have been provisioned within the same resource group. I would like to experiment further with the IoT suite, but not have things running while I'm not working on it. <p>	<strong>Edit</strong> <p>	Azure provisions two plans with Event Hubs, IoT Hubs, multiple storage and stream analytics instances. Although impressive, it is costly. <p> Can I stop or deallocate these services easily, or is the best course of action to provision and delete every time?</p>	"

(See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview</a>):</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>Your App Service plan can scale form Free and Shared SKUs to Basic, Standard, and Premium SKUs giving you access to more resources and features along the way. </p>	  	  <p>If your App Service plan is set to Basic SKU or higher you can control the size and scale count of the VMs.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>They can be scaled up/out easily. I do not know what plan is used now but maybe you can scale down? See <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/plans/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/plans/</a> for the available tiers. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-scale" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-scale</a> on how to scale up or down.</p>		<p>Scaling down might give a performance degradation but if it is just for experiments and not used for production I would give it a try. But beware: some parts of the IoT Suite might require a minimum tier of the App Service Plan that is used. (I have no experience with the IoT Suite)</p>		<p>You can't pause an App Service Plan, only option is to scale down or delete.

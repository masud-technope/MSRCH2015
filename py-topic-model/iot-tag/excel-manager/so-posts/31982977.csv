If I placed both server and client program on raspberry pi2 then it works, but when client is run from windows pc then it I couldn't connect , got error timeout(10060).

If you have changed that part, what other parts might you have changed without telling us?"

A tmeout error like that you will typically get if the server program has correctly created the listening socket and bound it and called `listen`, but doesn't call `accept`. Maybe add some extra logging to the server program to see that it actually calls `accept` and is not doing anything else."

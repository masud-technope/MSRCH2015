However, I would like to be able to use the device explorer Twin to send messages to the device. </p>		<p>I imagine that since the esp is sending messages to the Iot hub using an HTTP POST request, that I should be able to use an HTTP GET request to read the messages sent to the device when using the correct endpoint, outlined <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messaging#cloud-to-device-messages" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>		<p>Is this correct, or am I missing something?

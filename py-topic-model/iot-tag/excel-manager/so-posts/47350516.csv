I find a big difficultly to get a home-automation tool such as node-red, to get working multiple raspberry pi nodes.</p>		<p>On the master I use django(brain)+angular(web-ui)+pigpio-library to interconnect the master pi with slaves.	Basically using pigpio I can send from the master <code>turn-on</code> or <code>turn-off</code> signals to slave without any other tool. </p>		<ul>	<li>In my home configuration, I have 3 raspberry pi.</li>	<li>All 3 are connected to the same network.</li>	<li>1st pi is master and the other 2 are slaves.</li>	<li>2nd and 3rd raspberry pi are slaves, and only have pigpio service	installed</li>	<li>this give me centralized interface to n pi`s connected to my network</li>	<li>downside it that our app is not yet able to do complex things:events, tasks, etc.	So if I want to connect a PIR to my master and based on this trun on a LED on slave`s gpio, I cannot!</li>	</ul>		<p>In node-red or home-assistant, both use mqqt to send or receive information regarding sensors or manipulate gpio`s.</p>		<p>Can I have with node-red a centralized interface installed ok master pi, and from there to act upon a gpio on slave pi?</p>		<p>thank you	George</p>	"

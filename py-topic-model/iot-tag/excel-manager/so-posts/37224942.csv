Some documentation for this module state "8N1" with a baudrate of 115200, while other (such as the " NURDspace Wiki (Schematic, Datasheet, & More!)" linked from sparkfun goes to this [https://nurdspace.nl/ESP8266](https://nurdspace.nl/ESP8266), which states a baud rate of 57600. This other, French documentation [here](http://les-electroniciens.com/videos/arduino-ep16-installation-du-module-wifi-esp8266) goes with 9600... this really is hobbyist stuff..."

Assuming you have properly tested different baud rates and parity settings to no avail random noise is spit out when the chip is fried. Only reason I know this is because it happened to one of my ESP03 a while back. I could still flash the chip but multiple GPIO would behave randomly, serial coms were complete garbage, and I think my ADC stopped working if I recall. All in all, it's a 2$ chip you may have accidentally shorted. oh well."
37224942,61988857,37224942,3,0,Sat May 14 17:05:00 EDT 2016,5561305,"I've tried all baud rates, same result. And it isn't gibberish, the weird data appears only once during resetting otherwise it's complete silence nothing responding. Sometimes during testing it's not gibberish but some Fatal exception (0) or checksum0x0000 rooms 0 tail 8... Kind of thing.."

37224942,37318347,37224942,2,1,Thu May 19 08:53:00 EDT 2016,3392724,"<p>At the moment I can only give you a part answer (seems I can't comment yet :) ).</p>		<p>The gibberish is normal when starting/resetting the ESP, it's just the boot code which outputs a boot message at 74880 baud (Which is basically the default baud rate 115200, but because the ESP starts at a lower cpu frequency, the baud rate is also lower, boot frequency is 26 mhz, normal frequency is 40 mhz, 26/40 * 115200 = 74880. If you can set your serial client to 74880 baud you should see the message, but it's an odd baudrate, so it might be hard or impossible to set.</p>		<p>So gibberish on reset is good! It means the ESP is working and happy, the problem is with your software (as you determined yourself too).</p>		<p>I assume your code is on the Arduino side?	The big question is what is flashed on the ESP, and what it's expected bahaviour is. From your question I'm not 100% sure what you did flash on it..</p>		<p>I think you might've flashed nodemcu on it though, which would not respond to AT commands, try to flash the 'original' AT rom from Espressif Systems on it?</p>	"

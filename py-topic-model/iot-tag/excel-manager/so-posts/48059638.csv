The connections also seem right. I uploaded the code named as 'init.lua' into the ESP8266 using ESPlorer and was also able to control the LEDs through the app. But the next day when I tried controlling the LEDS I failed. Should I upload the code every time I unpower the ESP8266 module? What could be the issue?</p>	"

48059638,83112908,48059638,3,0,Wed Jan 03 00:14:00 EST 2018,6020403,"Assuming you saved the program to flash, the next thing to look at is whether you named it correctly or not.  NodeMCU expects to find a file named "init.lua" and runs that at power-on.  What (if any) error you'd be getting from the UART will reveal whether you're getting a bad filename or what.  It's also worth putting some debug prints in the code so you can see status from the UART."

You need to wait with any networking related functions until you get connected to the access point. Running <code>print(wifi.sta.getip())</code> immediately afterwards is likely going to "fail" i.e. not printing anything useful because you don't <em>have</em> an IP yet.</li>	<li>Save your application in a file called <code>init.lua</code> to persist it across power cycles.</li>	</ul>		<p>An example for the last two is documented at <a href="https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/en/upload/#initlua" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/en/upload/#initlua</a></p>	"

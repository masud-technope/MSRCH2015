I am using this kit to subscribe to a MQTT protocol via AWS and I am running into some issues. I successfully connect the first time, but then after a few seconds the connection is lost and when it reconnects it will either reconnect successfully or give me the following error (see link below)</p>		<p><strong>Error1</strong></p>		<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bih9k.png" alt="Error1"></p>		<p>After it attempts to reconnect a few times the following error shows up, which I think means there is no more RAM on the board and as a result there is no input.(see link below)</p>		<p><strong>Error2</strong></p>		<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NTZGn.png" alt="Error2"></p>		<p>Can someone please help me figure why it cannot maintain a connection? It says tls handshake error, could it be a issue with the certificates? I'm at a loss. </p>		<p>EDIT: Looks like the pictures don't work so here are the errors</p>		<p>1.Error: failed</p>		<pre><code>   !mbedtls_ssl_handshake returned 0x1. 	</code></pre>		<p>The other two errors it gives after attempting connection a few times is </p>		<p>2.Error: failed </p>		<pre><code>   !mbedtls_ssl_setup returned 0x7f00 	</code></pre>		<p>and </p>		<p>3.Error: failed </p>		<pre><code>   !mbedtls_ssl_write returned 0x7100 	</code></pre>	"

It will attempt to reconnect and sometimes it will result in a successful connect or it does not. After a few seconds it disconnects and goes into a cycle of attempting to reconnect until it finally gives the last two errors."

For <a href="https://eclipse.org/leshan/" rel="nofollow">Leshan</a>, the only source on how to write the spec file in json seems to be the official <code>oma-objects-spec.json</code>, which does not contain examples of objlinks.</p>		<p>Can anyone provide an example on how to create an objlink object?	If it is not possible in Leshan, have anyone tried other implementations?</p>		<p>Thank you</p>	"

I was also needed OBJLNK support in Leshan so i have modified and created a pull request for supporting OBJLNK.	If you want to have objlnk support can use my branch which is forked from Leshan.	<a href="https://github.com/DevendraKurre/leshan" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/DevendraKurre/leshan</a></p>	"

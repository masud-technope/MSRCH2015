We are using Contiki to program the board. </p>		<p>What I know so far is that, out of the 4 pins of sensor, VCC will be at one of the VCC port, GND will be to any one ground port, I don't want to use digital O/P, hence d0 won't be connected. And the last A0 the analog pic is connected to ADC7 pin of Md100.</p>		<p>In the program, I using the function adc_init() and then to read value I m using get_adc(7) where 7 denotes the channel. I am not getting any correct value from sensor. </p>		<p>So I wanted to know where am I going wrong. 	PS: I am not sure that as I have attached sensor with ADC7 the channel no should be 7. </p>		<p>Thanks in advance.</p>	"

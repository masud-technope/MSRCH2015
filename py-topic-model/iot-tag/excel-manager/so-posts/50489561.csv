Does anyone know if there are limitations, is this possible? </p>		<p>As I can see Orange PI 4g iot is still not compatible with Ubuntu but I hope it will be in the near future. Any information you could give  me i will be happy.</p>	"

You can also find the scripts they used for building the wheel (actually it's cross-built using a docker container) in directory <code>tensorflow/tensorflow/tools/ci_build</code> inside source code.</p>		<p>Some people also provided <a href="https://github.com/rezaxdi/tensorflow-on-orangepi-zero/blob/master/GUIDE.md" rel="nofollow noreferrer">guides for native building</a>, but it generally requires more effort to get it to work.</p>		<p>I suggest you start by trying the python wheel file for tensorflow v1.8.0 for raspberry pi armv7l architecture, <a href="https://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-pi/301/artifact/output-artifacts/tensorflow-1.8.0-cp27-none-linux_armv7l.whl" rel="nofollow noreferrer">found here</a>.</p>	"

Do you know how can I use LAG to get a previous value by time and not the last n event ?	For example when using a sliding window instead of tumbling window, if I use LAG, it will get me the previous value which is maybe 1s before.			I know I can just create 2 computations, one with tumbling and one with sliding window, but it would still be great to know if we can lookup into the past by unit of time and not unit of events."

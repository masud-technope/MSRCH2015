My biggest question is what board should I use and what other components do I need for the system?  I currently have a few <code>Arduino Uno's</code> and am thinking about ordering a <code>Ethernet Shield 2</code> to connect to WiFi but then I also found out about the <code>Arduino Zero</code> and the <code>WiFi Shield 10</code>1 as well as the <code>MKR1000</code> which both seem like good options.  </p>		<p>If anyone has some advice of where to start of has done something similar I would really appreciate hearing from you.</p>	"

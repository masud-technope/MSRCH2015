That is repeated every second. 	The readings I receive vary from 1 to 16 degrees, within just 2 or 3 seconds. Most of the time the reading is 12 degrees. The actual room temperature where the device is installed is around 20 degrees Celcius and is stable (indoors).</p>		<p>What could possibly be the cause and the solution for this? I have connected to a Raspi2 for 3.5V (pin 1), ground (pin 6), SDA (pin 3) and SCL (pin 5). No further resistors or capacitors. The DS1621 is just the DIP8 case, no breakoutboard or anything.</p>	"

The reason I have 0xAA is from the documentation: to read a single temperature value of 2 bytes. My code is posted here: https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=56CCD1B71E24988D!217306&authkey=!AH8iiKBpJDorUnA&ithint=file%2ccs"

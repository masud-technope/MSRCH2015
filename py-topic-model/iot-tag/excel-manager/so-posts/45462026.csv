I am trying to assess efficiency of my algorithm by adding nodes to the network randomly by a certain distribution (like Gamma distribution). To do this I have to write a script. The problem is, I can't add more than one mote using this script. Here is what I have so far:</p>		<pre><code>var motes_array = new Array(); 	moteType = mote.getType();	for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {	    motes_array[i] = moteType.generateMote(mote.getSimulation());	    mote.getSimulation().addMote(motes_array[i]);	} 	log.testOK();	</code></pre>		<p>The above code adds only one mote, although the loop is executed 5 times as expected.</p>		<p>I would be very grateful for your help.</p>	"

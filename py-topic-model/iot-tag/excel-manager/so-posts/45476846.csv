It is not a merkle tree like a typical blockchain. But I could not figure out this relation makes it quantum proof or not. Is no-mining, and peer verification enough to make a distributed ledger quantum proof?</p>	"

There is still some sort of PoW (when you submit a new transaction) but that is also irrelevant.</p>		<p>Basically with a quantum computer cryptographic one-way hash functions (like SHA-2, SHA-3, BLAKE2) are still ok with a few caveats, the same goes for block ciphers (like AES). Traditional public key cryptography (RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman and the eliptic versions) are however NOT secure anymore. So you can't have signatures (which is a quite necessary thing for cryptocurrencies). There are some complicated workaround constructions but the simplest is one based on hash functions (Lamport OTS). More references are in my question. Note that I still don't know how exactly IOTA does this. Basically I got stuck at reading about their Curl hash function.</p>	"

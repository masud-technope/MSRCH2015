I have a Ideetron <a href="https://webshop.ideetron.nl/LORANK-8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lorank8v1 gateway</a> which can work over distances of 15 km.</p>		<p>In addition I used the Ideetron <a href="https://webshop.ideetron.nl/Nexus" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Nexus</a> Board as a microcontroller and a <a href="https://webshop.ideetron.nl/Nexus_Demo" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Nexus Demoboard</a> where the sensors are mounted.</p>		<p>I'm sending 1 packet per minute with my humidity and temperature measurements.</p>		<p>After 200m my packets arenâ€™t captured by the gateway anymore.	I've ran the packet logger software on my gateway and all packets that are captured have a bad <code>CRC_CODE</code> verification which I think is due to interference.</p>		<p>I have thought that I may have some interference from LTE/3G/4G networks but these networks are not 868MHz band in Greece.</p>		<p>My gateway has 8 simultaneous channels and my node uses SF9 with a 125KHz bandwidth. When I changed these parameters nothing changed. I'm using it in a urban area.</p>		<p>What should I do?	Maybe I have to configure the datarate, the spreadingfactor and the frequencies at which my node transmits?	Are there any better ideas out there?</p>	"

50296751,87705508,50296751,3,0,Tue May 15 07:47:00 EDT 2018,1950945,"You might try to have a look at the RX info, i.e. RSSI (signal strength) and SNR (noise level). They could give a hint what's wrong here, especially if you start in a short distance from the gateway with a working connection and successively go farther away. With a (_LoRaWAN_) The Things Network setup you could also do a mapping for better visualization."

50296751,87686773,50296751,3,0,Mon May 14 16:48:00 EDT 2018,7552474,"Same. If you are using LoRa rather than LoRaWAN."

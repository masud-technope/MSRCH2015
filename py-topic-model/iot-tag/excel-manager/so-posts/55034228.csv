55034228,96880136,55036680,3,0,Fri Mar 08 15:25:00 EST 2019,1957873,"Green/red icon was just an example. I'm not really interested in this exact thing.	I explain better. At certain moment I open my AWS IOT console. How could I know what are the things connected in that moment? I could subscribe to life cycle events topic, but I *will* receive connected/disconnected events. I want to know if one a thing is connected *now* (through a red/green icon or a simple text string CONNECTED/DISCONNECTED)."
55034228,96849829,55036680,3,0,Thu Mar 07 17:46:00 EST 2019,1957873,"In this case I will receive connection/disconnection *events*. What about if I log in the console and need to know the current status of a thing? I expected a green/red icon that showed the current connection status. If I subscribe to events topic, I *will* receive events, but I'm in doubt about the current status."

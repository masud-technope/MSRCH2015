This is ugly in all respects, as repeating this 20 times hurts the eyes. I've set up two of them already, and it looks bad: 	<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7mD80.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7mD80.jpg" alt="Setting up TWO sensors for Dashboard is already hard"></a></p>		<p>My question is: </p>		<p>Is there a way I can give node-red a list of the Devices (well, their IP addresses) and have node-red create my desired Dashboard for all of them? Looks like I would need a "for-each" module, as well as something to automatically create a group in the Dashboard for grouping the various gauges/Charts to each sensor. </p>		<p>Not a lot of code to share so far, but I did create a gist for you to see, if you're interested in the webserver part for ESP8266: </p>		<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/digitaldias/3f3f617fb6273276b712fa990ecebf58" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Gist of how to Connect ESP8266 With Node-Red using Arduino/C</a></p>		<p>In advance, thanks for your tips and suggestions</p>	"

NR can subscribe to mqtt topics to process the data."
43019341,73126908,43019341,3,0,Sat Mar 25 17:17:00 EDT 2017,371933,"Yeah, that will be my second Version, already trying to wrap my brains aroudn how MQTT Works, Reading up on that now. However, would that solve my issue With 20 Points of telemetry?"
43019341,73126980,43019341,3,0,Sat Mar 25 17:19:00 EDT 2017,2318649,"In the sense that you wouldn't have to code the polling of each one because the ESPs all push their own data to the broker, yes. You will have to give each ESP a unique ID, you might be able to use their wifi MAC address to do that automatically."
43019341,73127049,43019341,3,0,Sat Mar 25 17:22:00 EDT 2017,371933,"Ok, so the broker would act as a Field Gateway then, in front of NR? how do I go about splitting those up into unique Dashboard Groups? I haven't found any examples yet"

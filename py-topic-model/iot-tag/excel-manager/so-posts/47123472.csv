During the search some websites says "buy sensors for Arduino" and some says "buy sensors for Raspberry Pi". So. if I buy sensors for Arduino, will they work with Raspberry Pi or not?</p>	"

(and each is case dependent). </p>		<hr>		<p>For example the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogInputPins" rel="nofollow noreferrer">arduino has analog pins</a>, but AndroidThings boards do not - you would need to use a Analog to Digital converter (<a href="https://github.com/blundell/ads1015" rel="nofollow noreferrer">like this</a> <em>or any other ADC</em>).</p>		<hr>		<p>Android Things <a href="https://developer.android.com/things/sdk/pio/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">supports these protocols &amp; interfaces</a>	- I2C	- SPI	- UART	- PWM	- I2S</p>		<p>If the peripheral uses one of these, then yes it will more than likely work an AndroidThings (a raspberry pi).</p>		<hr>		<p>AT also supports GPIO. However if the sensor only uses GPIO, it is likely to require a fast communication speed (in the range of 10's of nano seconds), but Android Things GPIO is slow (the frequency is in the range of 300Â± nano seconds) - so you'll probably find <em>these sensors</em> are not supported on AT (a raspberry pi). </p>		<hr>		<p>If after all that you buy a sensor and it won't work with Android Things - you can still use the sensor with an Arduino board and then control the Arduino Board with a Raspberry Pi as a master (<a href="http://nilhcem.com/android-things/arduino-as-an-i2c-slave" rel="nofollow noreferrer">like this</a>).</p>	"

Said that: please refrain from answering off-topic questions. With 50k reps, you should help moderating the site and close-vote them instead."

If I said "protocol/interface" would it please you? -1 for an answer that will clearly help the person is pretty pathetic just to try and "follow the rules".  Closing a legitimate question doesn't help anyone. If anything it should be migrated and if it was migrated the answer would go with it. Therefore I am happy I helped this person by answering the question."

Everything goes fine such as registering the Root CA, private key verification certificate etc. </p>		<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/setting-up-just-in-time-provisioning-with-aws-iot-core/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/setting-up-just-in-time-provisioning-with-aws-iot-core/</a></p>		<p>I don't normally post "what is wrong with my code" kind of questions, but i'm out of ideas with this one. When I try the last step to use the MQTT Mosquitto client to connect and publish to AWS IoT Core with the below command</p>		<pre><code>mosquitto_pub --cafile root.cert --cert deviceCertAndCACert.crt --key deviceJITPCert.key -h a9bqki6ij1hx9.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com -p 8883 -q 1 -t foo/bar -I anyclientID --tls-version tlsv1.2 -m "Hello" -d	</code></pre>		<p>I get the error :</p>		<pre><code>Client anyclientID4406 sending CONNECT	Error: A TLS error occurred.	</code></pre>		<p>I can't understand whatsoever what is the problem here with the handshake. All the keys and certificates are generated correctly. I have tried it from the start time and time again. Perhaps i'm missing one obvious step. If anyone with some experience might know what is going wrong i'd greatly appreciate it.</p>	"

I find that the first connect will fail with AWS IoT terminating the TLS session. However, the thing, policy and certificate are registered and subsequent connects succeed."

Since we cannot assign security right based on username/password (like read/write access to /user1 topic) like a standard <code>MQTT</code> broker, how can I protect user to send commands to unauthorized devices ?</p>		<p>I try to do something similar to this :	<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35439742/how-to-use-aws-iot-to-send-receive-messages-to-from-web-browser">StackOverflow - Amazon Client Side Application</a></p>	"

Then you could build authorization logic in your javascript application.</p>		<p>For example, based on the API key:</p>		<ul>	<li>subscribe to certain event topics "iot-2/type/<strong>device_type</strong>/id/<strong>device_id</strong>/evt/<strong>event_id</strong>/fmt/<strong>format_string</strong>"</li>	<li>subscribe to certain command topics "iot-2/type/<strong>device_type</strong>/id/<strong>device_id</strong>/cmd/<strong>command_id</strong>/fmt/<strong>format_string</strong>"</li>	<li>publish only to certain command topics "iot-2/type/<strong>device_type</strong>/id/<strong>device_id</strong>/cmd/<strong>command_id</strong>/fmt/<strong>format_string</strong>"</li>	</ul>	"

The problem is if someone get access to API Key (by looking at the code or unpacking mobile app), he can send command to any devices.  But he can not do this with the example above from Amazon AWS."

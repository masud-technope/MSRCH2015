I've used both the Quickstart and the Registered devices.  So far I've found that connecting to either service is intermittent.  Currently I cannot connect my device (using IBM internal IP) to the quickstart.  </p>		<p>I've set this up and tested in the past but lately it doesn't work (from 2 IBM sites).  I'm using the recipe verbatim except for the device ID/MAC address.</p>		<p>Pinging quickstart.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com returns a timeout.</p>	"

Another issue we faced was with the length of messages in the suggested <a href="https://github.com/256dpi/arduino-mqtt/pull/5" rel="nofollow">MQTT library</a>.</p>		<p>We ended up using ATSD instead of Bluemix for our IOT use cases with Arduino Uno devices and DHT sensors. <a href="https://github.com/axibase/arduino/tree/master/dataTransmission" rel="nofollow">Here</a> you can find an in-depth guide on setting up a temperature/humidity sensor paired with an Arduino device. Using the guide you will be able to stream the sensor data into ATSD using MQTT or TCP protocol. Open-source sketches are included.</p>	"

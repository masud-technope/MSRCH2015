However, I will have potentially thousands of things of the exact same type, though each with a unique serial number.  What I'm unclear on is how I manage this in Thingworx.  Does the thing identifier account for this, and if so, how?  Also, when updating values, how do I specify which 'thing' the updates apply to?  </p>	"

Can someone help me out with this issue?</p>		<ol>	<li>Is there a way to install .exe files while creating ffu base image itself? I could not extract inf file for the chipset exe</li>	</ol>	"

If you want to add a custom or third-party driver to Windows IoT Core ffu image, you need to build the custom ffu image with bsp. Please refer to this document about how to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/iot/add-a-driver-to-an-image" rel="nofollow noreferrer">add a driver to an image</a>. In addition,please note that, if your device is ARM, please contact the supplier of the peripheral to get the driver files. Here is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/learn-about-hardware/peripheraldrivers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sample</a> as reference about how to add third-party drivers (usb) for peripheral devices such as USB Mobile broadband modems, printers, scanners etc.</p>	"

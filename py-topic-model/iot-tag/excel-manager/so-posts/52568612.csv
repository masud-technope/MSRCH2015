The D1 mini is just an ESP8266 so you can follow the instructions for that: <a href="http://www.espruino.com/EspruinoESP8266" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.espruino.com/EspruinoESP8266</a></p>		<p>There are a bunch of tutorials and videos online as well that may be clearer. They're pretty easy to find just by searching for "Espruino ESP8266", or there's an ESP8266 section on the Espruino forum that may have help.</p>		<p>Other JS interpreters are available for ESP8266 too (eg. Mongoose IoT) but I believe you will find Espruino easier to get started with (I am however a bit biased as I work on it).</p>	"

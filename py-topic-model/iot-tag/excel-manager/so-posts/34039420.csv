I would like to read data from c# library. </p>		<p>I am able to work with Touch &amp; Motion sensor using c# script. I tried so many samples and my own code to read temperature sensor data but no luck for that.</p>		<p>Hope someone has try it before!</p>	"

Those sensors are pretty picky. 	Then I got a BMP085 and was able to get reliable readings from it with samples for the I2C hookup. This was pretty easy and stable.	I don't think they have the low level stuff in place to use the DS18B20 in Windows yet (early dec 2015). Something about the timing for the one wire protocol used. I assume it will be added at some point.	So you probably want to grab the library from huckster.io and add that to your project right now.</p>	"

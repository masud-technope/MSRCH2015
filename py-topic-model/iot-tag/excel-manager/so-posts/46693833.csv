All works now, except one point which confuse us. When we unplug the network cable from our raspberry Pi (I guess version 2) the Startup application with a GUI is immediately stopped. When we plug in the cable back, after a little time the Startup app is started again.</p>		<p>We use VS2017 to build arm UWP app.</p>		<p>Any idea how to prevent stop of application?</p>	"

Anyway how I would then create a foreground task?"

I believe that also an unhandled exception could be the cause, but I assigned already the UnhandledException event for App. Once I was seeing my msgbox, but not in unplug of Network cable, but it seems my file logger flushs not until app close."

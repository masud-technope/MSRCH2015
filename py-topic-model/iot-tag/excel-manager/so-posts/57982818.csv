As a temporary fix scaling it vertically fixes the issue to some extent but in that case I need to put all the pods in a single machine which I am scaling vertically and scaling multiple nodes vertically is quite expensive.	Hence I am planning to break down the system in a way so that I can scale horizontally and I am looking for suggestions for the possible ways I can achieve this.</p>	"

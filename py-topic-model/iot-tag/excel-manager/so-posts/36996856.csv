But when client code publish topic with payload {"temp" : 12} or any number greater than 10 in payload, rule engine should come in action and republish to topic 'sensor/alert' but unfortunately it not. 	 I have checked publish and subscribe logic with AWS MQTT client. In Client code publish and subscribe logic is working properly, but rule engine is not working.	I am using AWS free account.	I am not able to troubleshoot the issue. Any help is appreciated. </p>		<p>Thanks in advance.</p>	"

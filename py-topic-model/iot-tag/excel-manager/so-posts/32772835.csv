However, I think there is architecture difference as well as the way data is getting stored,processed and retrieved is also difference.</p>		<p>In this question, I wanted to know, what is the real difference (something very technical and internal operation) between these two.</p>		<p>Asking because, one of my trainer said, "cloud is for data storage and Big data is for data analysis", I'm not completely agreed and convinced by this statement.	As per my knowledge both can handle real time data analysis (in case of IoT data). And, there are tools available for this(in Apache).</p>		<p>Cloud was present previously which can handle large amount of data...Why Big data came into picture? What extra benefit its giving?</p>		<p>My question may be funny but your answer will give me real things to understand during client facing and requirement gathering and estimation and design.</p>		<p>PLease help. Your honest suggestion may help me to take a better decision, when should I go for cloud and when Big data? Thanks.  </p>	"

"Big data" is a fuzzy umbrella of things we do to handle large amounts of data and the techniques we use to extract information from it.  "Cloud" is a concept of handling real and virtual resources.		Can you perhaps clarify your question?"

32772835,53384904,32772835,3,0,Fri Sep 25 00:21:00 EDT 2015,4785185,"Again, these are not competing terms.  This is somewhat like asking, "When should I buy a memory stick, and when should I write a program?""
32772835,53391913,32772835,3,0,Fri Sep 25 07:10:00 EDT 2015,1837976,"Why you are saying this is not competing one? How can I convince one client weather to go with Cloud or Big data? or go with both?? What will give more benefit for them as they are paying. Please just think in this prospective, also please just do not think on storage prospective. By the way, here which one is memory stick and which one is write a program :)"

Big data gives us the capability to use service computing to process distributed queries across various data sets and return result sets in record time. <a href="http://www.orchestrate.com/blog/explore-the-new-age-of-cloud-computing/" rel="nofollow">Cloud computing</a> offers the underlying engine, characteristically through the use of Hadoop. Because these commodity server instances can be rented as needed, big data becomes inexpensive for most enterprises.</p>		<p>We always make discoveries as we use new knowledge, both good and bad. In the case of big data, the path to success will come with key lessons. But given the novelty of big data in real-world deployments, there are major queries for which we don't yet have answers -- so be extra careful in these areas.</p>	"

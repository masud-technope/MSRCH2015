Device to App communication: 	There will be a mac address based unique topic and device ID of each appliance . Each appliance will publish its data to topic of the server . The server will send the data to corresponding App over HTTP.  </p>		<p>App to Device communication 	The App will send data to server over HTTP and server will forward  the data to corresponding appliance over MQTT. </p>		<p>Now can you please guide me is this a correct way to do that ? or a better way is server should subscribe to unique topics of all appliances ?</p>		<p>Following is the flow diagram for the above mentioned procedure</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gbfAU.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gbfAU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>	"

Some MQTT Brokers can handle up to hundreds of thousands of msg/sec, your single server in the backend won't be able to handle such a load. Consider using shared subscriptions or a broker plugin for HTTP. If you're in the cloud, clustering (with load balancers in front) for HA and scalability may be worth looking at."

You will build security problems into your system, you will leak privacy of users and risk their devices. You will allow 100k more sytems to be part of a botnet."

However, my concern is also to get a better understanding of the MQTT standards. I have worked with an architecture in which the cloud server had one topic to which every device could publish to. Another way of doing it is that the server should subscribe to all the unique device topics. and listen what ever is communicated to and from the device.	Can you please suggest which system would perform better"

You can try two things - 1) Add a debug node just before the iotnode to determine how frequent you are forwarding the events to iotnode. 2) Provide the Node-RED flow so that I can try it at my end."

I am using Ibm quickstart which is sending the events to the node. When I am pushing the data to the cloud, I am getting data at 1 Hz rate. Can you suggest me anything?"

Quickstart can achieve data visualization, but a web page can just display one device.	Is the quickstart  a kind of service which deploy in the Bluemix? if I want to design a webpage to show visualization of multiple devices, can I deploy any kind of service to achieve this function in Bluemix?</p>	"

To do this, you should create an IoT platform service and register your devices rather than using Quickstart.  </p>		<p>See this <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/visualizing-your-data/" rel="nofollow">visualization recipe</a> for details.

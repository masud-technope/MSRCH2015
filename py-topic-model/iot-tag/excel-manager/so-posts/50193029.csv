When i run the app on my local machine (Win10, PC), all is fine, i can list the Folders and files, but when i try the same app on my RPi, i simply get a "The system cannot find the file specified" error. </p>		<p>What i did so far:</p>		<ul>	<li>Checked capapbilities (seem to be OK as i have Access from PC)</li>	<li>getting IPs from Network devices like NAS, Denon Heos Speakers, etc, 	so i have a working DeviceWatcher</li>	<li>i can pair the NAS to the System and read out properties</li>	</ul>		<p>my Question now is: How can i read the Folders on the NAS from a RPi with core IoT? Do i Need to pair (AEP, device pairing) the NAS to the RPi, and if yes, what do i need to do then? How can i pass the credentials to log in to the NAS?</p>		<p>i'm reading MS articles since days without success and i'm really stuck.</p>	"

Furthermore, this is my Setup:	- PC with Win10 (192.168.0.zzz)	- Rpi with core IoT (192.168.0.yyy)	- NAS with Synology, where all mp3 files are (192.168.0.xxx)		Now, i would like to connect to NAS from RPi to Play Music. Heres the Code to get the Folders:		StorageFolder folder = await StorageFolder.GetFolderFromPathAsync(@"\\192.168.0.xxx\");		Folder remains null"

Of course I would want each tenant to have access only to their own devices and not have the possibility to connect to devices from other tenants (thus I require the proper SAS).</p>		<p>Following the documentation on the ServiceConnect permissions, it would seem that it is not possible to do this restriction on a SAS level. I am expecting an URL like "{host}/devices/{device_id}/...." (where .... is devicebound or messages or something), but did not find a sample and the piece of code that I came up with result in Unauthorized.</p>		<p>I would like to know what strategies can I use to allow this multi-tenant connection to IoT hub. Did anyone manage to create a SAS with ServiceConnect to device specific URL? Is it even possible or what other workarounds are there for this scenario?</p>		<p>Also, if you have any samples with generating a SAS that allows me to use the endpoint {host}/messages/devicebound, I would appreciate it a lot.</p>		<p>Thanks,	George</p>	"

Devices can have the device-specific keys and all that but the same doesn't apply to services listening for data. One obvious option would be to create an IoT Hub per tenant :)"

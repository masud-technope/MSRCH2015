Am using Paho 's mqtt version -3.1 .. Websockets are getting created fine but i do not see the last will message ... </p>		<p>Can anyone guide here ? </p>		<p>Adding the bigger picture :</p>		<p>I have a Python script p gathering current on / off status of a IOT device in the local environment and publishing to a topic "IOT1" over mqtt  . I do not want the python script always running to get status from the IOT device as it overloads the device .. To solve this i am in need of finding active clients for "IOT1" topic so that i run or pause the thread sending requests to the IOT device in the local environment .. Is there a way other than the last will message to know this ?</p>	"

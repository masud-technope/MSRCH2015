The docs recomend using <code>*</code> as a wildcard character instead but do not describe its effects.</p>		<p>For example will the topic filter <code>:topicfilter:/foo/bar/*</code> match topic <code>foo/bar/baz/gaz</code> or only <code>foo/bar/baz</code>?</p>		<p>Specifically I am trying to allow access to any topic which begins with the thing name of the policy holder. So I would like to allow access to any topic beginning with <code>${thingName}/</code> and having any number of forward slashes and url parameters following a matching <code>thingName</code>. Would <code>topicfilter:${thingName}/*</code> work or would that only work for topics with one url parameter after <code>thingName</code>?</p>	"

An important thing to keep in mind is that <code>topicfilter</code> and <code>topic</code> are different and are different resources for different MQTT actions as outlined <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/action-resources.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. </p>	"

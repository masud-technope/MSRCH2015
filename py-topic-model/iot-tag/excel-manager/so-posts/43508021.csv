I'm trying to use the same code in a .Net core 1.1 (or Core 1.0) project but the package is not compatible.  Is there another package that provides the same device support?  </p>		<p>Really comes down to DeviceClient type as in:</p>		<pre><code>static DeviceClient deviceClient;	</code></pre>		<p>I could place the code in a 4.5.2 class library and try that.	Anyone have a full .net core device implementation?</p>	"

I went back to my sets of DLL's and tried the class library set to .net core 1.1 with the SDK referenced and the build worked.  I then compiled the 1.1 webapi referencing that DLL and everything worked (head scratch).  So, I must have had something off or cached.  Thanks for the help and the new SDK version"

The WebApi references a class library project targeting .Net standard 1.6 with the device client SDK (1.2.9) referenced. Class Library compile fails to recognize the SDK.  Still trying to figure out all these core/standard/.net variations..."

Can you please share the output when the error occurs? Also which version of Visual Studio are you using?"

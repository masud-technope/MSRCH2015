39522937,39522937,null,1,0,Fri Sep 16 02:29:00 EDT 2016,6312627,"<p>I'm working on a personal project where I want a PC to send a message to a Raspberry Pi. Since they are not going to be in the same network and I don't want to work with port forwarding, I tried using Weaved; however, I can't get the Raspberry Pi to receive any of the messages I'm sending from the PC.</p>		<p>The code for the Pi looks like this:</p>		<pre><code>   # Message Receiver	import os	from socket import *	host = ""	port = 13000	buf = 1024	addr = (host, port)	UDPSock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)	UDPSock.bind(addr)	print "Waiting to receive messages..."	while True:	    (data, addr) = UDPSock.recvfrom(buf)	    print "Received message: " + data	    if data == "exit":	        break	UDPSock.close()	</code></pre>		<p>For the PC the code looks like this:</p>		<pre><code># Message Sender	import os	from socket import *	host = "127.0.0.1" # set to IP address of target computer	port = 13000	addr = (host, port)	UDPSock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)	while True:	    data = raw_input("Enter message to send or type 'exit': ")	    UDPSock.sendto(data, addr)	    if data == "exit":	        break	UDPSock.close()	os._exit(0)	</code></pre>		<p>I've configuered the Weaved service to custom. I really need help, but I'm not sure that what I am doing is right. </p>		<p>The logic is correct in some way, because this works if the PC is in the same network as the Pi.</p>		<p>Thanks for the help!</p>	"

Or underlying video streaming architecture does not help the use case using CoAP/MQTT. I am expecting some good resources or examples to support or not support my question. I asked this question because I could not find good resource on video streaming over IoT protocols. Please help. </p>	"

You could implement video over MQTT as it supports binary payload <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc398718026">http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc398718026</a> but it is not what it was designed for.	Nothing prevent you to implement a multi-protocol device. MQTT for sensor streaming and TCP/UDP for streaming.</p>	"

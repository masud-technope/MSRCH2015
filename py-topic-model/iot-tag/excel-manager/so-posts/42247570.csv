I.e. is OPC or similar supported. Thanks. </p>	"

It uses a piece of software called "[firmata](https://github.com/firmata/arduino)" that allows the underlying [mraa library](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) to make it appear as though the I/O on the Arduino is attached directly to the app running on your NUC. Your Node.js JavaScript code runs on your NUC. This [Node.js PLC library](https://github.com/plcpeople/nodepccc) could be used as a starting point. Or, if you have a Linux C lib for PLC comms, you could build a node_module on top of that."

My question is if I can avoid using an Arduino board, i.e. has anyone collected data from Allen Bradley PLCs just using an Ethernet connection between the Nuc and PLC and if so what was the setup?"

What sort of IoT hardware setup are you considering? Based on your question, I'm guessing you are currently working with a NUC + Arduino 101 acting as a slave I/O device, is that correct?"

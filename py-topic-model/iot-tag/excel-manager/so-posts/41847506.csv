I have a payload (encrypted) and kay value pair in HEX. Could you help me which method shoud I use to the payload to I got the original payload?</p>	"

If so you could check <a href="https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lora_gateway" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TTN's github</a> as reference or just use TTN as your gateway.</p>	"

Is it an uplink message or a downlink message? You may refer to the <a href="https://www.lora-alliance.org/portals/0/specs/LoRaWAN%20Specification%201R0.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LoRaWAN specification</a> to figure out the message type. </p>		<p>Secondly, you may move ahead to understand how MAC frame payload is encrypted/decrypted. The section.4 in the specification can help you.</p>		<p>Thirdly, if you want to implement the encryption/decryption in , maybe this pure node.js repo can help you: <a href="https://github.com/anthonykirby/lora-packet" rel="nofollow noreferrer">anthonykirby/lora-packet</a>. Please pay attention to the LoRaWAN packet structure, there payload(data) is only part of the whole packet. You may filter the data first, and then do decryption. Hope this could solve your problem.</p>	"

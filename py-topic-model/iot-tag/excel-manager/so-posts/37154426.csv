On app start, <code>cf logs &lt;appname&gt;</code> shows </p>		<blockquote>	  <p>ERR Instance (index 0) failed to start accepting connections</p>	</blockquote>		<p>Is there any issue with the US-South region? 	What could be causing this issue?</p>	"

I've just tried to create a new application using the <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/mobilefirst-services-starter/" rel="nofollow">MobileFirst Services Starter</a> (leaving all the default settings): I'm able to see the example "HelloTodo" page and there are no errors in the logs. I used both the <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net" rel="nofollow">Classic UI</a> and the <a href="https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net" rel="nofollow">"New Experience" UI</a>. I suggest you to try again, it should work.</p>	"

But "you" means the AWS customer, and would list all devices registered under that AWS customer's custom endpoint.</p>		<p>But what if an AWS customer has multiple end users, that authenticate via e.g. Amazon Cognito Identity and they each have a number of devices. You would not want to have an end user list all e.g. thermostats of a specific brand/standard, but only the one actually registered to him. This is a use case I imagine would be very common, yet I can find no example in the AWS IoT sample code or documentation.</p>		<p>My only idea is to use a "UserId" attribute for each thing, and then filtering on this, when doing a ListThings on the thing registry. But how would you make sure that a user could only list his things, and not other users' things - an IAM policy per user?</p>	"

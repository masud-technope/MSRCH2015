I know the data is making it into the Watson IoT cloud, since I can see it under "recent events" in the device panel.  However, I'm getting an "Imported Unrecognized Type: wiotp-credentials" error when I refresh Node-RED.  </p>		<p>Any idea where I'm going wrong?</p>	"

There are slight differences in the nodes and also credentials don't import.  You might want to add a new IBMIOT (Input) node and then create new credentials.  Take or create the API keys from your organisation-access-api keys (https://.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/dashboard/#/access/apikeys</p>	"

I had two browsers open with NodeRed, one for bluemix and the other for a Pi ... and inadvertently cut &amp; pasted some node information from the Pi to blumix.  Once I removed the errant node, everything worked fine.</p>	"

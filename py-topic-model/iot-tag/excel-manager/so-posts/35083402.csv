You should have searched far and wide for an answer, have tried many possible solutions and detail what you have tried. If you've done all that, then and only then if you still cannot find an answer to your problem do you admit defeat and submit to the shame of asking a question. "I've done nothing, please write my program for me" is not what stackoverflow is about."

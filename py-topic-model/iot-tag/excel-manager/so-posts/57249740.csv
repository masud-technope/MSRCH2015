For example, Sometimes slow network may causes the problem that previous events reached after newer events. In this case, I need to reorder the events with timestamp before excute some logics.</p>		<p>I think i can use Esper for my project but not sure yet.	I'm really new to Esper.</p>		<p>So i want to know whether Esper is suitable for my projects.	And Is there any example for ordering events with esper using java? </p>		<p>Thank you.</p>	"

It is called <a href="http://esper.espertech.com/release-8.2.0/reference-esper/html_single/index.html#view-time-order" rel="nofollow noreferrer">time_order</a>. You often use it together with <a href="http://esper.espertech.com/release-8.2.0/reference-esper/html_single/index.html#apiruntime-time" rel="nofollow noreferrer">controlling time using the API</a>.</p>	"

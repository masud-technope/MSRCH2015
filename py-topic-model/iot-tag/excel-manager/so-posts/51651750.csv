I want to update some devices remotely (they will be installed about 8000km away from my working place). I have found out that LWM2M would fit to my scope.</p>		<p>Because the internet connection there is not stable and the bandwidth is low, I have decided to also install a Raspberry Pi to collect the data of the sensors and to install a Leshan server to trigger the updates.</p>		<p>I have tested the devices and I can register them to the Leshan server on the Pi, read some data, and reboot the devices. The problem is, I don't know where to save my binary file for the update, so that the device can download them.</p>		<p>I tried following steps:</p>		<ol>	<li>Save the file on [leshan-dir]/update.bin.</li>	<li>Write the "Package URI": coap://[raspi-IP]:5683/update.bin<br>	After that, the backgroud color of the button "Write" changes to green.</li>	<li>Execute the update</li>	</ol>		<p>The response of the server is 404 [Not Found].</p>		<p>I have looked for any API to find out where I can save the .bin file, but without success. And because nobody seems to have had a similar error, I start thinking I have missed some points.</p>		<p>Where do I have to save the files on the Raspbery Pi, so that I can perform an update?</p>	"

I decide to change the ones of the file-server to 5685 and 5686</p>		<p>When both server runs I can insert in <em>Package URI</em> something like:</p>		<pre>coap://[[ip_of_the_pi]]:5685/data/[[name_of_the_firmware_file]]</pre>		<p>Probably there are better solution for it, but for a coap/lwm2m beginner like it works very well. </p>		<p>Note: If you  have bigger file to transfer you can also change the property MAX_RESOURCE_BODY_SIZE</p>		<p>I hope this may help somebody.</p>		<p>Regards,</p>		<p>Elvys</p>	"

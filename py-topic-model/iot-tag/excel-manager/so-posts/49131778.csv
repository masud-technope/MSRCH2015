Messages will be sent to AWS Kinesis via IoT rule.</p>		<p>So is there any limitation, saying that we can publish up to a certain number of messages per second to a MQTT topic.</p>		<p>When we tried with higher number of messages per second, after a certain limit (700 messages per second) messages were lost and not stored in Kinesis.</p>		<p>Having multiple topics to publish data, will resolve this issue?</p>	"

For example, <strong>a single message published</strong> on $aws/things/device/shadow/update topic <strong>can result in publishing three additional messages</strong> to $aws/things/device/shadow/update/accepted, $aws/things/device/shadow/update/documents, $aws/things/device/shadow/delta topics. In this case, <strong>AWS IoT counts those as 4 inbound publish requests towards this limit</strong>. However, a single message to an unreserved topic like "a/b" is counted only as a single inbound publish request.</p>	</blockquote>	"

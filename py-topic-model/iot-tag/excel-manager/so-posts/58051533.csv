I want to see feeds that each device send to Platform. So a feed can be inserted value from several device. 	My solution is create feeds for every single device. But this solution is not good because will create  a lot of feeds.	Is there any way to handle many device on IoT Platform ? or is there any platform that support multiple device ? thanks</p>	"

Represents "queue" or "p2p" behavior when multiple subscribers with same clientID can be connected/subscribed to the same topic and only one subscriber instance (load is balancing automatically) receives particular message. Against of pub/sub topic model, when all subscribers receive copies, this is very convenient to use in software architecture as we don't need to use one more "player" message queue to distribute load between parallel application instances.</p>		<p>In case if IoT, messages published by devices can be consumed by several application instances, working in parallel, to distribute load between them.</p>	"

IBM MessageSight and HiveMQ both have different implementations of a version of shared subscriptions."

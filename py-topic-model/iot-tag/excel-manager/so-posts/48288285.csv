So, my question is that can you mix and match brokers for this communication? For instance, Mosquitto broker on device 1 and ActiveMQ Broker on device 2. Will this work?</p>	"
48288285,48288906,48288285,2,4,Tue Jan 16 19:58:00 EST 2018,504554,"<p>I think there might be a slight misunderstanding here.</p>		<p>In a simple deployment there would only be 1 MQTT broker that multiple MQTT clients (on one or many devices) would connect to this one broker and exchange messages on any topics. As long as all the client conforms to the MQTT specifications then they should be able to connect successfully to any broker implementation.</p>		<p>If you want a more complex deployment then it is possible to have multiple brokers and have groups of clients connect to different brokers. You can then set up what is known as a bridge between the brokers which allow the to share some/all of the topics. This allows messages to be shared by all clients regardless of which broker they connect to.</p>		<p>Assuming all the brokers conform to the MQTT spec (which is very likely) then it all should just work, but how you configure bridges differs between broker implementation.</p>		<p>Be aware that a new version of the MQTT spec (v5) just went live (end of 2017), brokers and client libraries will be updating to support this over the coming weeks/months. So check what versions you try and connect with.</p>	"

48288285,48327596,48288285,2,1,Thu Jan 18 18:00:00 EST 2018,5567437,"<p>Usually there's a bridge mode to connect brokers together, even for different kind of brokers such as Mosquitto and ActiveMQ, this is not only a concept in MQTT brokers but also in other message queue. Also, some kinds of brokers support with clustered, such as RabbitMQ. Official Mosquitto only support bridge, but there's a clustered mosquitto implementation on <a href="https://github.com/hui6075/mosquitto-cluster" rel="nofollow noreferrer">hui6075/mosquitto-cluster</a>, it is easy to deploy.	Besides, the most significant different with "cluster" and "bridge" is that with clustered, the whole brokers looks like one logic broker for external clients, such as session, retain, qos, etc.</p>	"
48288285,48436537,48288285,2,2,Thu Jan 25 05:59:00 EST 2018,8504033,"<p>Yes. Two different MQTT brokers can communicate with each other. Mosquitto broker and ActiveMQ broker can work together but only one of the brokers needs to be configured to act as a bridge. Mosquitto (and some other MQTT brokers) have a feature called bridging which basically lets you connect two or more brokers together.</p>		<p>A Mosquitto broker (server) can be configured to work as an MQTT bridge. A bridge lets you connect two MQTT brokers together. They are generally used for sharing messages between systems. A common usage is connect edge MQTT brokers to a central or remote MQTT network.</p>		<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/bridge_protocol" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Bridge Protocol</a> of MQTT community and <a href="http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mosquitto-bridge-configuration/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mosquitto Bridge Configuration</a>.

And the identification of instructions can be from either the source code or just the executable(with no source code).</p>		<p>Does anyone know about some tools or techniques?</p>		<p>In a nutshell, how to automatically locate security-sensitive code?</p>		<p>EDIT: I believe now I have come to understand my task better. I do not have to use a tool to protect but devise a technique of my own to protect my code statements( written in C Language) which are vulnerable. Especially Anti-debugging statements. 	Are there any heuristics to find out the vulnerable statements in the code. like authentication points and Anti-Debugging checks?</p>	"

Think more of questions like "How does this tool work?" instead of "What tool should I use?" I know it can be frustrating sometimes"

It's just that I am new here and don't know all the guidelines and proper ways to ask a question. Also, I have seen a number of posts asking for suggestions and they have been answered. So, didn't want to edit my question too much.  But, Thank you!"

The heuristics you have are the known tools (like https://www.checkmarx.com/) and reading _a lot_ of blogs on the topic (like: http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/). You are in charge on how it will work. If you like my answer, please select it as the answer :-)"

Can you suggest some other blogs as well. I am reading about it but I find some of them unsuitable for a beginner and/or not specific to what I need. My task is to find out vulnerable statements and give them as input to a tool  developed for protecting statements."

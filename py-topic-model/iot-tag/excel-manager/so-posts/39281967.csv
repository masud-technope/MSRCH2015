The rfid readers act as keyboards. Basically they just read the id on the rfid token "type" it in and press enter. </p>		<p>I need to be able to tell which rfid reader is reading a tag at any given time. </p>		<p>Using the following project : <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17123/Using-Raw-Input-from-C-to-handle-multiple-keyboard" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17123/Using-Raw-Input-from-C-to-handle-multiple-keyboard</a> on a windows 10 machine with multiple usb rfid readers plugged in I can tell which rfid reader is being used but cannot get this to work on the raspberry pi running Windows 10 IoT Core. </p>		<p>I have create a UWP app using the Windows.Devices.HumanInterfaceDevice namespace and can get the reader to show up but cannot open it.</p>		<p>The code I am using is:</p>		<pre><code>string selector = HidDevice.GetDeviceSelector(0x0001, 0x0006, 0x08FF, 0x0009);	var hidDevice = await HidDevice.FromIdAsync(selector, FileAccessMode.Read);	var inputReportEventHandler = new TypedEventHandler&lt;HidDevice, HidInputReportReceivedEventArgs&gt;(this.OnInputReportEvent);	hidDevice.InputReportReceived += inputReportEventHandler; 	</code></pre>		<p>When I configure the Package.appxmanifest with:</p>		<pre><code>&lt;DeviceCapability Name="humaninterfacedevice"&gt;	  &lt;Device Id="vidpid:08FF 0009"&gt;	    &lt;Function Type="usage:0001 0006"/&gt;	  &lt;/Device&gt;	&lt;/DeviceCapability&gt;	</code></pre>		<p>and compile the application I get the error:</p>		<p>Error       DEP0700 : Registration of the app failed. The Appx package's manifest is invalid.: Cannot register package because of a problem with Function element usage:0001 0006: Value is blocked, and not allowed on this bus (0x80073cf6)</p>		<p>So it looks like Microsoft has blocked access to the rfid reader using the Windows.Devices.HumanInterfaceDevice namespace (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.humaninterfacedevice.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.humaninterfacedevice.aspx</a>) because it has been classed as being in a a top level application collection. </p>		<p>So my options are:</p>		<ol>	<li><p>Try and get the raw input app working (from the link to the codeproject site above) but I don't think that will work on the pi due to the underlying calls it is making.</p></li>	<li><p>Put a different OS on the pi and rewrite the kiosk application (I would really rather stick with Windows IoT and c# with a UWP app. </p></li>	<li><p>Think of a different solution that I hope some smart person reading this post will be able to suggest.</p></li>	</ol>		<p>Any suggestions would be welcomed!</p>	"

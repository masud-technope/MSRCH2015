For Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), there is no limitation on the number of connections, and that is purely dependant on the hardware's/stack's capabilities. The Bluetooth specification does not put a limit on the number of connections for BLE, and therefore the theoretical maximum depends on Bluetooth-related timings (namely connection interval and connection supervision timeout).</p>		<p>For a more detailed answer about the number of connections. please see the link below:-	<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39174115/2215147">https://stackoverflow.com/a/39174115/2215147</a></p>		<p>I hope this helps.</p>	"

I have modified my comment to reflect that."

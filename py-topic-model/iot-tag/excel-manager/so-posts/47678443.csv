This system uses ROS (Robot Operating System) and therefore we had to install Ubilinux. Our system requires being connected with a 360-degree laser (RPLIDAR-360) that sends data through a serial channel, so we are trying to get laser's data through USB-to-UART adapter (Silicon lab's CP2102) (the PixHawk only has a USB available for data transfer).</p>		<p>In summary, the laser is connected to the USB2UART adapter, and the adapter is connected to Edison's serial port.</p>		<p>However, we are stuck with some kind of driver issue. When tracing 'dmesg' the device is detected (idVendor=10c4, idProduct=ea60):</p>		<pre><code>[  917.812195] usb usb2: Product: xHCI Host Controller	[  917.812214] usb usb2: Manufacturer: Linux 3.10.17-yocto-standard-r2 dwc-xhci	[  917.812232] usb usb2: SerialNumber: dwc3-host.2	[  917.812858] xHCI xhci_add_endpoint called for root hub	[  917.812878] xHCI xhci_check_bandwidth called for root hub	[  917.813141] hub 2-0:1.0: USB hub found	[  917.813185] hub 2-0:1.0: 1 port detected	[  918.128982] usb 1-1: new full-speed USB device number 2 using dwc3-host	[  918.151786] usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=10c4, idProduct=ea60	[  918.151818] usb 1-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3	[  918.151839] usb 1-1: Product: CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller	[  918.151857] usb 1-1: Manufacturer: Silicon Labs	[  918.151875] usb 1-1: SerialNumber: 0001	</code></pre>		<p>With the following details:</p>		<pre><code>T:  Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#=  2 Spd=12   MxCh= 0	D:  Ver= 1.10 Cls=00(&gt;ifc ) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  1	P:  Vendor=10c4 ProdID=ea60 Rev= 1.00	S:  Manufacturer=Silicon Labs	S:  Product=CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller	S:  SerialNumber=0001	C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=80 MxPwr=100mA	I:* If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=ff(vend.)

We were unable to download the headers through APT, but at the end, we managed to compile the '.ko' module by downloading the headers manually from a Website.</p>		<p>However, after doing:</p>		<pre><code>insmod cp210x.ko	</code></pre>		<p>We got:</p>		<pre><code>Insmod: ERROR: could not insert module cp210x.ko: Invalid module format	</code></pre>		<p>So, at this point we have several questions... any advice about any of them would be really appreciated:</p>		<ol>	<li>Does anybody know how to install the Kernel headers in Ubilinux - 3.10.17?</li>	<li>What is the official procedure to upgrade the Kernel in Ubilinux?, we already have ROS working on the board... do you think a kernel upgrade could mess our ROS configuration?</li>	<li>In general, do you have any successful experience in the configuration of a cp210x device?</li>	</ol>		<p>Thanks in advance,</p>		<p>HÃ©ctor</p>	"

Just use the correct udev rule file (not present by default in linux distro). An example is <a href="https://github.com/RishiGupta12/SerialPundit/blob/master/tools-and-utilities/99-sp-cp210x.rules" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. With this file /dev/ttyUSBX will be created.</p>	"

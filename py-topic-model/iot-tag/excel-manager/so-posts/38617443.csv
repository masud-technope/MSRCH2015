IPSec endpoints are from what I know not very common.</p>		<p>Therefore TLS would be the recommended solution. I don't have experience how much ROM a TLS implementation needs, however you should be able to decrease the size by compiling the TLS library yourself. 	Most TLS libraries are only large because they have to support 4 SSL/TLS versions and dozens of ciphers.</p>		<p>Disable all unused modes (SSL, TLSv1, TLSv1.1) and ciphers. You have to check what ciphers are supported by your cloud service provider and adapt them in the TLS library accordingly. In the end you should only keep TLSv1.2 and one may be two ciphers. </p>	"

GPRS provides an IP channel and on every IP channel you can establish a TCP connection and therefore also a TLS connection (as a TLS connection is just a TCP connection with encrypted content). And if you have to use UDP instead of TCP you can use D-TLS (for UDP) instead."

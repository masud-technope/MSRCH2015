So if you run the application on the same computer as the HiveMQ: 	Broker Address: <code>tcp://127.0.0.1:1883</code></p>		<p>Otherwise:	 use <code>ifconfig</code> (Mac/Linux) or <code>ipconfig</code>(Windows) command in terminal to determine your external or internal IP-address </p>		<p>Broker Address: <code>tcp://'ip-adress':1883</code>.</p>	"

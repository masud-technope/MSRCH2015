Curious to know how it actually works, how does the data get to Bluemix from the car and is there a need to have an external app/device in the car to collect and post data to Bluemix something similar to Aviva's Rate my Drive app?</p>	"

You can have MQTT client in each driver's smart phone. </p>		<p>I am not familiar with the Aviva's Rate my Drive app, but as far as I searched, you might be able to develop similar kind of application which can analyze driving behavior from car probe data with the <code>Driver Behavior</code> service.</p>	"

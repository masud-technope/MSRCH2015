I've tested <a href="http://ms-iot.github.io/content/win10/samples/PowerShell.htm" rel="nofollow">this procedure</a> on Windows 10 PowerShell, works fine.  Be sure to follow the step to "Remove-Module PSReadline". I was trying to use setcomputername to rename my RPi2 and the command would fail with a command not found error.  Once I removed the PSReadline module, the command started working.  Hopefully Jason gets this fixed as PSReadline is just too valuable to remove for long.  :-)</p>	"

The only way to run commands on Win10 IoT is to use PowerShell as described by Keith in this thread or you can use SSH or Telnet. You can interact with applications run on the device via the local display, keyboard and mouse.</p>		<p>Mark Radbourne [MSFT]</p>	"

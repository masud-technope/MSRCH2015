Does anyone has an idea about the two frameworks ?</p>	"

Consider transportation and smart grids - those are completely separate industries. for example, in transportation - geo analytics is much more important than in smart grids where meters tend to have fixed locations.</p>	"

The reason I'm suggesting it is mostly because IBM documentation is typically comprehensive and include high level overviews. In case of bluemix, the devices communicate to message brokers via mqtt protocol that provides asynchronous bi-directional communication (pub/sub)."

Since the paper is not uploaded yet to the internet Please get in touch with me in case you want to read it.	I will provide a link here as soon as I upload it.</p>	"

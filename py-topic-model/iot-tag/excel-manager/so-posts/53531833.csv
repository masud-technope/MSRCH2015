I am using the RadioHead library to interface with the radio module.</p>		<p>My goal is to have my Feather send sensor data at regular intervals. I also want it to be able to receive commands remotely which switch attached devices on and off. I have it connected to a battery and a solar panel. The solution I have so far is this</p>		<pre><code>void loop()	{		    if (rf95.available())	    {   	        handleRFInput();	    }		    unsigned long currentMillis = millis();	    if (currentMillis - previousMillis &gt;= TIME_BETWEEN_PACKETS)	    {	        // Sends the data	        sendSensorData();		        // save the last time data was sent	        previousMillis = currentMillis;	    }	} 	</code></pre>		<p>There are a few problems with this. The first, and biggest, problem is that I can easily lose incoming data. The second is that the processor is always running and I can't make it sleep with the fear of losing incoming messages. I'd like to preserve as much power as possible by letting it sleep for as long as possible. </p>		<p>The obvious solution for this problem is having an interrupt fire when a new message is available. I can't figure out how to do this. There is a pin, #7, in the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-32u4-radio-with-lora-radio-module/pinouts" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> that says it is an IRQ. I tried </p>		<pre><code>#define RFM95_INT 7		attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(RFM95_INT), handleRFInput, CHANGE);	</code></pre>		<p>but when I ran it nothing happened. No sensor data was transmitted or anything. What do I need to do to be able to get an interrupt when a message arrives?</p>	"

However, when I do this, it just spins.  </p>		<p>I found the similar question where someone else hit a launch dashboard problem on a MAC where they got it working on another platform, so I tried it from Windows.  Windows is working fine.  But, I can't get the dashboard from my Mac, which is the laptop I want to work on.  The similar question had no resolution, and wouldn't let me add a comment to it, hence a new question.  </p>	"

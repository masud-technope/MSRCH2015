We are looking at flutter or ionic as hybrid mobile framework so that we can have a common codebase across mobile platforms.</p>		<p>Can flutter or ionic mobile app interface with Thermapen through Bluetooth? What is the plugin/add-on to be used for bluetooth communication from these frameworks? Will that be a reliable solution to expand the interfaces to more bluetooth devices in the future?</p>	"

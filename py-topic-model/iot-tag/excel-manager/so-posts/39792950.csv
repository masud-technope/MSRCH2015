Use <code>cf api</code> to verify that you are connected to the API endpoint you would like to authenticate against.</p></li>	<li><p>Your organization requires the <code>--sso</code> flag. This uses a one-time password to login.</p></li>	<li><p>Your API endpoint is behind a firewall, so you need to VPN into the right network.</p></li>	</ol>	"

(This is for use with an IoT hub). I tapped into my GoGoGate2 via IP and it brought me to a browser based UI. I used WireShark to sniff out HTTP requests that were firing on the open event. I came to the conclusion that the door could be open and closed via the following HTTP request.</p>		<p><strong>OPENS DOOR:</strong>	<a href="http://device-ip/isg/opendoor.php?numdoor=1&amp;status=2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://device-ip/isg/opendoor.php?numdoor=1&amp;status=2</a></p>		<p><strong>CLOSES DOOR:</strong>	<a href="http://device-ip/isg/opendoor.php?numdoor=1&amp;status=0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://device-ip/isg/opendoor.php?numdoor=1&amp;status=0</a></p>		<p>Okay that was simple enough. When I fire the HTTP request from a computer or phone on my network, the request works and the door opens and closes perfectly. However, when I attempt to fire the HTTP request from my Hubitat, the event is not firing. I attempted to use my HTTP exactly as written from an incognito window in chrome and I received a message "Restricted Access". So apparently the Hubitat needs some sort of authentication to speak to the GoGoGate2 device.</p>		<p>Is there some way I can tap into my Hubitat and use it to connect to my GoGoGate2 and have it save the login credentials? That's how I did it from my phone/computer. Is there no way to do this exact same thing from the Hubitat itself?</p>		<p>Sorry if this is a noob question.</p>		<p>Please note I have also tried using the format <code>login:password@device-ip/isg/opendoor.php?numdoor=1&amp;status=2</code>with no success</p>		<p>Also, not sure if this is of assistance, but during the authentication process on the Garage Door Opener, the login is performed by performing a post method. From what I have sniffed out, this is the relevant information.</p>		<pre><code>Request Method: POST	Request URI : /index.php/index.php	Connection: keep-alive\r\n	Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\r\n	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n		Form Item: "login" = "mylogin"	Key: login	Value: mylogin		Form Item: "pass" = "mypass"	Key: pass	Value: mypass		Form Item: "sesion-abierta" = "1"	Key: sesion-abierta	Value: 1		Form Item: "send-login" = "Sign In"	Key: send-login	Value: Sign In	</code></pre>		<p>I am unsure how to pass post information in via HTTP request, if anyone has some insight on how to do this, or a work around?</p>		<p>Thanks in advance,</p>		<p>Andy</p>	"

54612525,54612576,54612525,2,0,Sun Feb 10 01:37:00 EST 2019,235354,"<p>Since the login is form-based, it seems likely the credentials are stored as cookies. If these cookies are long-lived, then you might be able to re-use them when connecting to the API. Is it possible to specify cookies in the HTTP request? Otherwise, is it possible to execute a sequence of multiple requests from the device - a POST to authenticate then the operation.</p>		<p>Alternatively, you could host your own proxy on the local network that performs the login and the subsequent request internally. This can be done with programmatically with curl in PHP. Here's an example: <a href="http://blog.andyhunt.info/2011/12/21/using-php-and-curl-to-log-in-to-a-website/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://blog.andyhunt.info/2011/12/21/using-php-and-curl-to-log-in-to-a-website/</a></p>		<p>Make sure to use the CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR option to store the authentication cookies from the login form so they can be included in subsequent requests.</p>	"

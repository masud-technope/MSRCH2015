The values I am constantly getting are between 19 and 20: </p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XiEVB.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XiEVB.png" alt="Obtained values"></a></p>		<p>As you can see, on clapping I get a spike of the value. </p>		<p>The thing is that the values don't change at all when loud music is playing, only getting different values when it detects a loud noise (like clapping).   How can I change the code or system to get the values in decibels?</p>	"

The switching threshold is set by the potentiometer on board of the microphone module.</p>		<p>What you would need is a low-level amlified microphone. Then you would get an input range from 0 (no noise) to 1023 (loud noise). This value then could be mapped to decibel. But again - not with this module. </p>		<p>Regards	Harry</p>	"

The board you're using has a Digital output which outputs a signal whenever it's threshold it's exceed the limit you set on the potentiometer (yes the potentiometer you were moving just set the limit when the microphone will output a digital pulse).</p>		<p>So you have you should purchase another microphone like <a href="https://www.fasttech.com/product/1000700-arduino-compatible-microphone-sound-detection" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this one</a>.</p>		<p>The one you have only tells you if there is sound or no sound.</p>	"

Stream analytics job works fine but I have heard that it is not "right" way to parse data in Azure. So what is the right and best way to do that. I need to save it to SQL database.</p>	"

56020108,98685075,56020271,3,1,Tue May 07 10:33:00 EDT 2019,10348788,"Thank you for the answer! The data needs to be real time because I have IoT sensor which basically calculates how many people are in the room and sends that data to iot hub. So is there any other/better way to do that than stream analytics job?"
56020108,98685405,56020271,3,1,Tue May 07 10:44:00 EDT 2019,1537195,"I would agree with Murray. Stream Analytics is a very good fit for this job. Where did you hear that it's not the right way? If you need more customizable options, Spark Streaming on Azure Databricks is also an alternative - but it includes much more coding and management for you"
56020108,98685453,56020271,3,0,Tue May 07 10:46:00 EDT 2019,2061133,"You can use Structured Streaming with databricks as an alternative - I have updated my answer with a link."

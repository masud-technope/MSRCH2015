When the client receives some data, it is supposed to pass it to an arduino to activate different controllers (like a motor, some leds ...). So, I wanna send data from a openmote to an arduino. The idea is to use a bus. The openmote is the master and the arduino is the slave. Do you have any idea how to do this ? I can't find any documentation fro the open mote part. I thought about using the serial UART but i don't have any idea how to do that. </p>		<p>Thank you !</p>	"

You have to pay attention to the speed you are using on both sides.You can refer to this file to see the functions to use: <a href="https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/blob/master/examples/cc2538-common/test-uart.c" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/blob/master/examples/cc2538-common/test-uart.c</a></p>	"

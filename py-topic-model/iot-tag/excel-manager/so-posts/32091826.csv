So, which is better, requesting the webservice every 1 or 2 seconds, or opening a socket with the server to guarantee the real time operations.</p>		<p>Taking into Consideration that working with sockets, may require me to write a lot of bunches of codes, as there's no frameworks for socket over ARM for example.</p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

They are not specific to 1..2 seconds vs. 30 seconds. Simply put: if you need it faster use a single connection but at the cost of more resources required at the server."

Also you can choose, Rest/Coap with nodejs as the request will be waiting until node will give response	In this both scenario, real time communication can be approached without any socket and refreshing time.</p>	"

There are some good protocol to help you implement this, like MQTT. </li>	<li>For the second case above, requesting a web service to receive realtime operations will work, but it's definitely not a good idea. It will increase your server's load and your device's energy consumption. </li>	</ol>		<p>After all, you need to make your choice on your product's requirements.</p>	"

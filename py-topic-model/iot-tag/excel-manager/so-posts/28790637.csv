I changed the interval from 1000ms to 100ms and to 3000ms and reuploaded to the Edison. No change. Light still blinks every second same as before. I even changed the app version info to try to force it to see the update.</p>		<p>I must be missing something obvious.</p>	"

What I've done since is get into the routine of:	 + Stopping the app (the far right icon, the one you click to run the app)	 + Then click the stop app icon (next to it on the left)	 + Save my file	 + Click upload	 + Click run</p>		<p>Going through this process I never run into the issue you describe. When I do forget a step, I can often replicate what you experience!	Good luck!</p>	"

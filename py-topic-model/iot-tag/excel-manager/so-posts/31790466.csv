I don't want to show Windows logo, but black screen is also bad idea (because of no feedback).	In Windows 8/10 tablets I have seen branded boot screen, so it is possible there, but not sure how to achieve this in Windows 10 IoT.</p>		<p>According to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj963199(v=winembedded.81).aspx" rel="nofollow" title="Unbranded Boot Overview &#40;Standard 8&#41;">Unbranded Boot Overview (Windows Embedded Standard 8)</a>:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>The only supported way to replace the boot logo in Standard 8 with a custom logo is to modify the Boot Graphics Resource Table (BGRT) on a device that uses UEFI as the firmware interface. If your device uses the BGRT to include a custom logo, it is always displayed, and Unbranded Boot cannot suppress the custom logo.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>I know it is for Windows Embedded, but that is the closest article I found about branding.</p>		<p>I don't know how the Raspberry Pi 2 booting works and whether it has UEFI or what. I guess it is at lower level.</p>	"

I am not aware of an easy way to do this in Linux, so it is fairly unlikely many people have learned how to do it with Windows yet, if its different at all."

I found that to achieve this it is enough to use only the last command `bcdedit /set bootuxdisabled on`. But I want to see the progress ring (just not the Windows logo) or replace that windows logo with a custom picture."

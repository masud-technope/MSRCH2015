The worst thing is mqtt service remains unavailable during this time so users can't use our product and they start calling our customer support and we have no valid reason to satisfy them, leading to very bad user experience. </p>		<p>This issue has been occurred three times in last couple of months. </p>		<p>We tried to get some solution from AWS developer support but no benefit.</p>		<p>Could anyone please suggest a way that we can use to provide service to our customers when this issue occurs? </p>		<p>We are using nodemcu esp8266 and mongoose os on hardware side.</p>	"

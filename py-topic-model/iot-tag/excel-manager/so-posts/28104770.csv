You can then access that PTY as any regular serial port in Linux.</p>		<p>There might be a problem if the port is created dynamically - you won't know the name of the PTY device. So the plugin also includes discovery service functionality. It is a TCP server that returns the name of the PTY.</p>		<p>Here's Python code that can be used to get the name of the PTY using this discovery service:</p>		<pre><code>    address = "localhost"	    port = 6100		    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)	    sock.settimeout(3.0)	    sock.connect((address, port))	    data = ""	    while True:	        c = sock.recv(1)	        if c not in ['/', '.'] and not c.isalnum():	            break	        data += c	        if len(data) &gt; 100: break	    sock.close()	    return data	</code></pre>	"

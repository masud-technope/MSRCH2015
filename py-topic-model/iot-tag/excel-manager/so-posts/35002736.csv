Continuous dictation (number 7 in the menu), goes Idle right away once I press "Dictate" button.	Microphone permission is on, and everything stayed the same from the 10.0.10240 release which worked perfect.</p>		<p>Note that it only doesn't work when deployed to Minnow Board or Dragon Board, but works locally on the Windows PC.</p>		<p>Any idea on what could cause that? I've tested multiple times and when I revert back to 10.0.10240 it starts working again, but it doesn't work on the newest release.</p>		<p>Github link to the Microsoft Sample UWP C# project: <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/SpeechRecognitionAndSynthesis" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/SpeechRecognitionAndSynthesis</a></p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

I can easily connect and debug at the Raspberry, but if I only want to deploy, kind of nothing happens. I use the Guide for deployment here: <a href="https://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/AppDeployment.htm#csharp" rel="nofollow">https://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/AppDeployment.htm#csharp</a> </p>		<p>Also on the Raspberry Pi2, nothing seems to have happened. My Visual Studio Output is like the following:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>1>------ Deploy started: Project: BlinkyWebService, Configuration:<br>	  Release ARM ------ 1>Creating a new clean layout... 1>Copying files:	  Total &lt;1 mb to layout... 1>Checking whether required frameworks are 	  installed... 1>Registering the application to run from layout...<br>	  1>Deployment complete (10237ms). Full package name:<br>	  "BlinkyWebService_1.0.0.0_arm__1w720vyc4ccym"    ========== Build: 0	  succeeded, 0 failed, 1 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========<br>	  ========== Deploy: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 skipped ==========</p>	</blockquote>		<p>(I kindahow can't format it better?)</p>	"

You have to deploy and start both of them. 	The HttpServer project starts a new HTTP Service on port 8000 on the raspberry pi.

If you configure visual studio to debug the application on the remote device it should start automatically. 	If you then want to autostart the application on reboot you can try this link [link] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30040440/windows-10-iot-raspberry-pi-2-autostart-published-application this is something I havenâ€™t tested yet."

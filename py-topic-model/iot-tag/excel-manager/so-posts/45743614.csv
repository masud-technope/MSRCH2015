The Process Doorbell flow (on the raspberry pi) should send an IBM IoT visitorAlert event message to Node-RED on Bluemix which should, in turn, send an IBM IoT sendPicture command message back to Node-RED on Raspberry Pi.  This will eventually create a Base64 encoded image string, package it up with the filename, length and status into a payload that gets sent to Cloudant in Bluemix by the insertPicture node.  See if it worked by going to the Bluemix Cloudant dashboard."</p>		<p>I created the flows on node-Red, but am getting this error on the node-red in the pi: </p>		<blockquote>	  <p>"Error stopping node: Error: [BaseClient:disconnect] Client is not	  connected"</p>	</blockquote>		<p>I am getting this error on the node-red in Bluemix: </p>		<blockquote>	  <p>"Error: Connection refused: Not authorized"</p>	</blockquote>		<p>What could be the issue?</p>	"

On Pi I connected light sensor which will update shadow after every 30 sec.</p>		<p>Now I want to write a client (Mobile app or Web app) who will also listen to same shadow and notify me. For same reason I am trying to connect my ubuntu machine with AWS IoT using node js. Now when I run sample examples mentioned on this <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-sdk-node.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> I only see screen with message connected. When I update shadow from AWS console I should receive a message on node side. Am I right with my understanding or I am doing any mistake. If this is not a right approach then what is right approach? </p>		<p>Code am trying to execute is <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js/blob/master/examples/echo-example.js" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>		<p>and command which I am using to execute is </p>		<pre><code>nodejs examples/echo-example.js --host-name=AYYCW0HM971XS.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com --certificate-dir=/home/sangam/iot/certs --thing-name=thirdthing --debug	</code></pre>	"

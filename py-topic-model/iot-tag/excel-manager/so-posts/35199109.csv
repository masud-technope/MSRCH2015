I've inserted the SIM mobile card with Internet connection available.	Through serial monitor I'm communicating with it with no problems, but when it comes to make a GET or a POST request to a webserver page it returns Network Error (601).	Here it is:</p>		<p>AT+SAPBR=3,1,"CONTYPE","GPRS"	OK</p>		<p>AT+HTTPINIT	OK</p>		<p>AT+HTTPPARA="CID",1	OK</p>		<p>AT+HTTPPARA="URL","http://:8080/folder/savedata.php"	OK</p>		<p>AT+HTTPACTION=0	OK	+HTTPACTION: 0,601,0      //601: Network Error</p>		<p>AT+HTTPREAD=1,100000	OK</p>		<p>And no response of the "echo" of the php page...	Do you have any suggestion?	Thanks in advance.</p>		<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/KFtSD.png" rel="nofollow">enter image description here</a></p>		<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/MFuf7.png" rel="nofollow">enter image description here</a></p>	"

I think some main concepts are that you need to successfully attach and startup GPRS connection.</p>		<p>Some things that need to be active before this will work:</p>		<p><strong>1) Network registration</strong></p>		<pre><code>AT+CREG?     should return 0,1    if so, skip to 2)	</code></pre>		<p>if it doesn't then you can start by turning on and off the modem by inputting AT+CFUN=0 and then AT+CFUN=1</p>		<p>if you are still having problems registering make sure you have selected the correct network:	    AT+COPS?    should see your service providers name in the results 	eg. 	    AT+COPS: 1,0,"T-Mobile USA"</p>		<p>If you don't, then make sure your band is set properly to your service provider. Look up your providers 2G band	e.g. t-mobile uses PCS_MODE for their 2G service. set this via:	    AT+CBAND="PCS_MODE"</p>		<p>Also, obviously you should make sure you have signal:	    AT+CSQ    should return at at least a 5 or 6</p>		<p><strong>2) Network Activation</strong></p>		<pre><code>AT+CIPSHUT   	AT+CGATT=1      - this can take some time to get through. I have a 40 sec timeout	</code></pre>		<p>Its important for this step to work. If it doesn't perhaps restart your modem. But this is a key part.</p>		<p><strong>3) setting PDP context and bringing up GPRS service</strong></p>		<pre><code>AT+SAPBR=3,1,"CONTYPE","GPRS"	</code></pre>		<p>set your APN: find out what your 2g APN is from your provider. 	e.g. for t-mobile: epc.tmobile.com	define your APN:</p>		<pre><code>T+SAPBR=3,1,"APN","epc.tmobile.com"		AT+SAPBR=1,1        This is the most important part to get through. Sometimes it takes a while to get through, I have a timeout on this part for 3 minutes to let it work.	</code></pre>		<p>if this doesn't give you an error proceed:</p>		<p><strong>4) sending HTTP</strong>	Basically proceed with what you have...</p>		<p>an example of what I do:</p>		<pre><code>AT+HTTPTERM	AT+HTTPINIT	AT+HTTPPARA="CID",1	AT+HTTPPARA="URL","www.google.com"	AT+HTTPACTION = 0      This should return 200 if it is successful	</code></pre>		<p><strong>5 shut down GPRS</strong></p>		<pre><code>AT+CIPSHUT    this may give you an error buts its not important	AT+SAPBR=0,1     can take awhile 	AT+CGATT=0       also can take a while	</code></pre>		<p>anyways I wrote some pretty neat lightweight code for arduino to send data via HTTP. I also wrote one for SMS. let me if you want to take a look. I use a SIM800L   -- one of the cheap breakout boards.</p>	"

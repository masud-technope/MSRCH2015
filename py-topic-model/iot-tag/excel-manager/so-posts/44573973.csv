Using the function New-AzureRmIotHub to create the hub. All is well, except that I can't figure out how to define some of the more advanced settings. In particular, I want to define the Cloud2Device Partitions parameter. This setting is under the Monitoring settings within the Azure portal. I was thinking it can be set through 'Properties', but I can't find any doc for this.. Here is what I came up with, but it does not work...</p>		<pre><code>$c2dprops = New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Management.IotHub.Models.PSCloudToDeviceProperties -Property @{Partions=32} 	$props = New-Object Microsoft.Azure.Commands.Management.IotHub.Models.PSIotHubInputProperties -Property @{CloudToDevice=$c2dprops} 		$IotHub = @{	  ResourceGroupName = $resourcegroup;	  Name = $hubname;	  SkuName = $skuname;	  Units = $units;	  Location = $location;	  Properties = $props;	};	New-AzureRmIotHub @IotHub;	</code></pre>	"

Unfortunately I've had to just look at the C# implementation of the PowerShell types.</p>		<p>The good news is that it's on GitHub, see <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell</a>.  There is good stuff in <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/tree/preview/src/ResourceManager/IotHub" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/tree/preview/src/ResourceManager/IotHub</a> and below.  I suggest you Clone the entire Repository and then open IotHub.sln in Visual Studio and read the code.</p>	"

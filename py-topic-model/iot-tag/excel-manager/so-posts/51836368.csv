Through serial port I'm able to view statistics of the device, configure device and do firmware updates. I want to do all these remotely by enabling IoT. I have just gone through Azure IoT hub, iBOT etc. </p>		<p>How will I enable communication between my serial port with IoT hub? </p>		<p>Is there any supporting device for that? </p>	"

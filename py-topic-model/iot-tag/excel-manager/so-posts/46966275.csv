If this is the "correct" answer - ok. If you need more detailed advice, I think you should provide more details in your question to get some thoughts or experience from anyone. Because now the question seems too generic. Naturally, some DPI algorithm (and this is very "broad" notion) may be built to classify somehow any kind of IP packets, a sensor as a packet source does not contradict anything... so what?.."

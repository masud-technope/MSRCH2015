I use NodeMCU esp8266 to send Data to Azure IoT Hub. But It only said " Connected " and it didn't monitor or return value Json in Device Explorer.</p>	"

So I guess the answer is no, you can't switch from HTTPS to HTTP. </p>		<p>Can you give more details on what sample code you're using, how you're building it for NodeMCU, etc?</p>	"

We tried to sent the data from the NodeMCU but seems like the Microsoft Azure was not received the data that has been sent from NodeMCU. Some said that the NodeMCU doesn't support HTTPS."

35794120,60490278,36414748,3,0,Tue Apr 05 21:52:00 EDT 2016,6051924,"Got it. I'm not familiar with NodeMCU but I'll be looking forward to other folks contributing to the answer. if I get my hands on one, i'll try."

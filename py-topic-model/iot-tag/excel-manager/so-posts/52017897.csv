The problem is it sends raw telemetry data including weird characters and stuff like that. I figured out it was in a CSV format but I still can't parse it.</p>		<p>My question is,	I want to take the raw telemetry data directly from the blob and parse it into a SensorResult class using C#.	I figured out how to read the blob data I just need to parse the telemetry data.

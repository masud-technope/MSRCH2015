I've done psudo-continous data streaming using AWS Firehose service with `boto3`."

Check the link here;	<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_multithreading.htm" rel="noreferrer">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_multithreading.htm</a></p>		<p>From this part you will define the functions as classes and initialize them with Thread library in an another class (like main). After that, in the main class you can define a mutual file (which can be tinyDB), in order to save the data inside the Pi 3 &amp; safely deliver them to Cloud.

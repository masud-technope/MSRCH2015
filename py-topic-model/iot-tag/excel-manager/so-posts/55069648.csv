Most IoT devices are automated and don't even have "users" in the traditional sense (temperature sensors, scanners, toasters, etc).  So they communicate back to whatever central aggregation point they've been configured to communicate back to.  Google Cloud IoT is just a framework for setting up such an aggregation point.</p>		<p>The device you're referring to could possibly communicate back to there, but only if its designer told it to do so and there are many other alternatives to Google's they could have used instead.  If you want to find out where the device is sending its data I'd recommend sniffing the network traffic for destinations, protocols, and payloads.  They could provide you some clues.</p>	"

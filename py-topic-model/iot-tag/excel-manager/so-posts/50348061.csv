As the signal is ultra narrow band I can't convert it to 100 Hz by down sampling or filter and down sample?could you please help me?</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FCSVa.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FCSVa.png" alt="Signal"></a></p>		<p>the image above is my signal after sampling. i can read the signal as it is dbpsk modulation but after down sampling it will be destroyed.</p>	"

Start with a CIC filter with a down sampling factor of 25 and perhaps order 3. As you are doing it offline you can also consider to take a very sharp IIR filter and then down sample it. Take also a look at `decimate`. In general you should inform yourself more about down/up sampling and filtering."

I design this filter: nb_filter = designfilt('lowpassfir', 'FilterOrder', 50, ...	                 'CutoffFrequency', 110, ...	                 'PassbandRipple', 1, 'StopbandAttenuation', 60, ...	                 'SampleRate', 250e3); and then i resample(mysignal,1,2500) but it's  not working.could you please give me more suggestion?I would you so thankful"

I don't know if the [comm.DBPSKDemodulator](https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/ref/comm.dbpskdemodulator-system-object.html) is helpful to you.	Could you upload a piece of your data to dropbox or something?"

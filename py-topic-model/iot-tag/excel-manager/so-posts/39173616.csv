I have simple code in LUA language. </p>		<pre><code>gpio.mode(4,gpio.OUTPUT)	gpio.write(4,gpio.LOW)	wifi.setmode(wifi.STATION)	wifi.sta.config("Livebox-C408","7255E6262488CC90482CE6F264")	print(wifi.sta.getip())	</code></pre>		<p>When I send program to ESP8266, Esplorer shows below error.</p>		<pre><code>stdin:2: '=' expected near 'a'	stdin:2: ')' expected (to close '(' at line 1) near 'TATION'	</code></pre>		<p>Sometimes(~10%) I can send above program to ESP8266 without problem. In my opinion, ESP8266 is damaged. What do you think about my problem?</p>		<p>Anticipating your questions, login and password to my home wi-fi are correct.</p>	"

See <a href="http://frightanic.com/iot/comparison-of-esp8266-nodemcu-development-boards/" rel="nofollow">my comparison</a> for details.</li>	<li>Your code is doomed to "fail" because it doesn't consider the fact that <code>wifi.sta.config()</code> is asynchronous i.e. it won't block until an IP address was assigned. <code>print(wifi.sta.getip())</code> will eventually print <code>nil</code>. We have an <a href="http://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/en/upload/#initlua" rel="nofollow">example for a better boot sequence in the docs</a>.</li>	<li>Your device most likely is not damaged.</li>	<li>In the ESPlorer settings tinker with the turbo and dumb modes. I have "Turbo Mode" on and "Dumb Mode" off. Futhermore, set your baud rate to 115'200.</li>	<li>In case you haven't done so already I strongly suggest to <a href="http://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/en/flash/#upgrading-firmware" rel="nofollow">upgrade your firmware to a recent version</a>. See <a href="http://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/en/build/" rel="nofollow">here</a> how to build it.</li>	</ul>	"

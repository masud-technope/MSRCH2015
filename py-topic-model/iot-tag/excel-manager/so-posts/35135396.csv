An API is available on github and its complete documentation is available on the AWS official site for this purpose.	<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/tree/master/aws-java-sdk-iot" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/tree/master/aws-java-sdk-iot</a>	<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/index.html</a>	I could not find a single example for it in java supporting MQTT or HTTP protocol. Are there any examples?</p>	"

Node, Android and iOS(Swift) are posted so far. You could reuse the Android work, but... </p>		<p>Second point, AWS IoT supports straight up MQTT/TLS connections so you could just use the off the shelf Paho client. Docs are <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/java/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>		<p>For HTTP posting, you can simply use the CLI. Hope this helps</p>	"

35135396,58080002,35135883,3,0,Wed Feb 03 15:49:00 EST 2016,5168103,"yes. i wrote following https://gist.github.com/sharonbn/4104301 link.	But accroding to this mqtt java api doesn't have any method to directly accept X.059 certificates for SSL connection as available in Python api. is there any more efficient way to acheive this?"

I am a software engineer so I don't know much about hardware to use in this process. I want to do this task in php. It would be very great for me if anybody can help me to achieve this task. Please suggest me any other language if PHP is not suitable for this task.</p>	"

They have small devices you can place between the plug and appliance that connect to home network and you can access via web service.</p>		<p>I'm not sure if they still do it but found this article:  <a href="http://www.cepro.com/article/using_web_services_to_control_devices_through_vista_media_center/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cepro.com/article/using_web_services_to_control_devices_through_vista_media_center/</a></p>		<p>It was Life|ware WSD.  You might check with other home automation vendors and see if they expose an API, but note the media server in your home will likely need a static IP address for Internet connection, then you will need to route requests on desired port to that computer in your router configuration if you want to access from the outside world.</p>		<p>If you are coding in-house, then your laptop/pc will be connected to same network as media server so you can just reference it via interal IPs.  If Linksys router, for example, it might default to 192.168.1.3 (assuming .3 is address assigned when device requested IP).</p>	"

If you need to control the devices themselves, it may require C or more primitive.  You might also look into servos that can be controlled over a network.  A former girlfriend's dad actually did it on a Tandy TRS80 I believe in BASIC (don't ask me how) about 15 years ago."

If you know Java, you could expose commands as web service API and then use PHP to call the API endpoints.  http://www.eletronlivre.com.br/jhome/"

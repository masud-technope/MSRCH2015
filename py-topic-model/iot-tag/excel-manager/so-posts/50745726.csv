Consequently there is a limit on the size of a string that can be passed in one of these UTF-8 encoded string components; you cannot use a string that would encode to more than 65535 bytes.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>So you have 2 bytes (making up a 16bit number) which make up the length of the string, followed by that many bytes containing the actual string.</p>		<p>Both the username and the password are transmitted in this format.</p>	"

You need to first figure out which protocol the device is using ( MQTT is popular for such devices so that might be it, in which case see https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/mqtt.html)"

52590765,92116884,52590765,3,2,Mon Oct 01 12:27:00 EDT 2018,126769,"@Alien TCP/UDP protocol is a transport protocol. On top of that there are many hundreds of different protocols that define what the data look like and what procedures must be taken to make communication work. It is not enough to just know that it is "a TCP protocol". e.g. HTTP is a protocol on top of TCP. Unfortunately none of the documents at your link gives any further description as to what protocol this particular device uses on top of TCP, so you have to do further investigation or contact the vendor and ask them for more documentation."

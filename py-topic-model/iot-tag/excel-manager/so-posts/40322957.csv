This is using the Watson IoT Starter boilerplate. Git is connected.</p>		<p>I have deleted and recreated that application multiple times but continue to encounter the same issue.</p>		<pre><code>"404 Not Found: Requested route ('courserastartapp.mybluemix.net') does not exist."	</code></pre>		<p>Is anyone else having the problem? Any suggestions?</p>	"

Are you restarting without giving it enough time to complete the process?  Try waiting about 5 minutes after deploy to view the route.  If it still does not work then check the deployment logs and let us know what errors you see.  </p>		<p>Edited to add: we hope to have a fix in place soon</p>	"

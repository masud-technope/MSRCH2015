I tried with all COM port but without any success. I then thought that it was a driver issue but it seems that everything is fine with the drivers => When I plug my rfxtrx433 I can see that my IOT system recognize it (it displays rfxtrx433 under connected devices section and devcon command says that drivers are running for this device)</p>		<p>Has someone any idea what I have to do to communicate with my device?</p>	"

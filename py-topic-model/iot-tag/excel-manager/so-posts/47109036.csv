47109036,81281483,47114909,3,1,Tue Nov 07 19:21:00 EST 2017,516661,"Apple has an official technical note called "Technical Note TN2459: User Approved Kernel Extension Loading" which describes this new process that Apple added in MacOS X High Sierra. It applies to any third party kernel extension. All kernel extensions for MacOS X must be signed using a special key from Apple and then must be approved by the user. There is currently no extra level of certification available to third parties to allow Kernel Extensions to load bypassing this step.		This is not a problem specific to this driver or specific to Silicon Labs. Its not a "bug"."

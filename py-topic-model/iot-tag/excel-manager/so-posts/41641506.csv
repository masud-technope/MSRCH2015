My raspberrypi has a local Mosquitto broker which is bridged with remote Cloudmqtt. So as soon as I publish a topic via my android app it is received on the raspberrypi console.	Here comes the problem.  As soon as I receive the msg on my raspberrypi console it should execute a python file. How can it be done?</p>		<p>I write this following command to receive the topic</p>		<pre><code>mosquitto_sub -h host_name -p port_no -u remote_user_name -P remote_password  -t hello/today/world	</code></pre>		<p>Now as soon as I receive a msg through the topic <code>hello/today/world</code> I have to run a python file that makes decisions according to the msg received from the topic(if the msg received is <code>on</code>, the led turns on)</p>		<p>But the main problem is that how can we read the msg and execute the file accordingly?</p>		<p>This morning I saw someone posted a similar question and I took up the challenge to find out the solution but I am not getting any way to do so.</p>		<p>I tried to write in shell but it didn't work </p>		<pre><code>c=mosquitto_sub -h host_name -p port_no -u remote_user_name -P remote_password  -t hello/today/world	if ( c == "rushabh welcome to garden assistant" )	then	   GPIO mode 12 out	   GPIO mode 12 1	   GPIO mode 12 0	else	   echo "not matched"	fi	</code></pre>		<p>Since I want to turn on the led at gpio 12 as soon as I receive <code>rushabh welcome to garden assistant</code> from the mosquitto broker</p>		<p>Can we use <code>$SYS/broker/messages/stored</code></p>	"

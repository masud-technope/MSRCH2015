Visual Studio is set to run on Remote Machine (It automatically located the device, it is authenticated and everything). The build seems good and there isnt any errors (<a href="http://prntscr.com/8x9zl8" rel="nofollow">http://prntscr.com/8x9zl8</a>). The raspberry pi 2 shows the splashscreen for a second and than I get this: <a href="http://prnt.sc/8x9z0m" rel="nofollow">http://prnt.sc/8x9z0m</a>. I checked my developer licence it says its activated. I tried building Windows-AnyCPU instead of Windows-ARM, still no luck. The first time it was adding the files, now it is changing the files <a href="http://prntscr.com/8x9zh7" rel="nofollow">http://prntscr.com/8x9zh7</a> (I guess that is okay) but I am not able to run it. </p>		<p>When I try to add the .appxrecipe manually to the raspberry via the web interface it shows the following error (<a href="http://prntscr.com/8xa08k" rel="nofollow">http://prntscr.com/8xa08k</a>). Cordova builds AppxManifest.xml, resources.pri file and .appxrecipe and since I was able to select only one file in the web interface I added appxrecipe.</p>		<p>Any help would be appreciated since I dont see many questions about creating windows app for iot core using cordova.</p>		<p>Edit: I tried "cordova remove platform windows" and readding it again doesnt work. The project works on physcial android device/google emulator/riddle/windows app on my local machine</p>	"

I needed to build the application as uap (Universal app)	"cordova build windows -- --appx=uap"</p>		<p>Than I manually added the appx file and the certificate via WindowsIOT user interface and it installed successfully! Now I am able to run the application without problem :)</p>		<p>Edit: Screenshot: <a href="http://prnt.sc/8xf9b0" rel="nofollow">http://prnt.sc/8xf9b0</a></p>	"

The code is really simple, just an AppBar and a couple of AppBarCommand buttons. The program runs just fine when run as Any CPU -> Local Machine. However, when run as ARM -> Remote Machine, it throws the runtime error. Interestingly, using breakpoints, I've found that the offending code is not run at all when using the Local Machine, so no runtime error.</p>		<p>The error occurs when a default tooltip is created for the AppBarCommand. Here is the code:</p>		<pre><code>                // Set system attributes if it is in WWA, otherwise, use the default values	            if (!hasInitWinRTSettings &amp;&amp; _WinRT.Windows.UI.ViewManagement.UISettings) { // in WWA	                var uiSettings = new _WinRT.Windows.UI.ViewManagement.UISettings();	                mouseHoverTime = _TransitionAnimation._animationTimeAdjustment(uiSettings.mouseHoverTime);	</code></pre>		<p>The runtime error is:</p>		<p>0x8007059f - JavaScript runtime error: Invalid system-wide (SPI_*) parameter.</p>		<p>The interesting thing is that uiSettings contains this value for some of the settings, including mouseHoverTime, which causes the runtime error above.</p>		<p>Any ideas why the call to _WinRT.Windows.UI.ViewManagement.UISettings should result in some erroneous setting values?</p>		<p>Regards,</p>		<p>Paul</p>	"

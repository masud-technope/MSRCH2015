"wind" : 234,	      "air" : 345	   }	 }	</code></pre>		<hr>		<p>The station has some interactive properties like <code>_led1</code> and <code>_led2</code> which I can also report and update via Shadows service by setting "desired" state. To do that I can send to a device message like that:</p>		<pre><code>{	 "state": {	   "desired": {	      "_led1" : "on",	      "_led2" : "off",	       ....	      "_lock99" : "open"	   }	 }	</code></pre>		<p>Thanks to shadow service <em>Whenever device gets online</em> it will receive synchronized state and will turn the leds and locks into desired position.</p>		<p>However, <strong>sometimes I want to operate the device in real-time</strong>: when troubleshooting a device - I want to send a real-time command to reboot it - and if device is live and receives the message I want to reboot it. If device was offline, then nothing happens (the reboot command never reaches the device).</p>		<p>So what would be the best way to control device in real-time?  Still try to play with the shadows service to achieve that? Or simply create a separate topic eg. <code>my-things/{thing_name}/real-time-commands</code> and force device to subscribe to it?</p>	"

It consist of 3 elements.:</p>		<ul>	<li><p><strong>Azure Sphere certified microcontrollers (MCUs):</strong> A new cross-over	class of MCUs that combines both real-time and application processors	with built-in Microsoft security technology and connectivity. Each	chip includes custom silicon security technology from Microsoft,	inspired by 15 years of experience and learnings from Xbox, to secure	this new class of MCUs and the devices they power.</p></li>	<li><p><strong>Azure Sphere OS:</strong> This OS is purpose-built to offer unequalled	security and agility. Unlike the RTOSes common to MCUs today, our	defense-in-depth IoT OS offers multiple layers of security. It	combines security innovations pioneered in Windows, a security	monitor, and a custom Linux kernel to create a highly-secured	software environment and a trustworthy platform for new IoT	experiences.</p></li>	<li><p><strong>Azure Sphere Security Service:</strong> A turnkey, cloud service that guards	every Azure Sphere device; brokering trust for device-to-device and	device-to-cloud communication through certificate-based	authentication, detecting emerging security threats across the entire	Azure Sphere ecosystem through online failure reporting, and renewing	security through software updates. It brings the rigor and scale	Microsoft has built over decades protecting our own devices and data	in the cloud to MCU powered devices.</p></li>	</ul>		<p>These capabilities come together to enable Azure Sphere to meet all 7 properties of a highly secured device â€“ making it a first of its kind solution( refer <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-microsoft-azure-sphere-secure-and-power-the-intelligent-edge/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this link</a>).</p>		<p>Would you minding sharing with us more about your usecase where you need to embed Azure Sphere with other MCUs?</p>	"

For showcasing our capability in security and to give them assurance about security,we want to embed Sphere chip-sets into our pi or Arduino board.This is why i am asking how Sphere chip will make our device secure? what extra feature it is providing to our device?"

And you can refer the detail info from [this link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SevenPropertiesofHighlySecureDevices.pdf) about how the security feature by adding the **Pluton security subsystem** to the exists MCU."

It came with Node MCU and I used it to flash Arduino programs through it's IDE and Arduino programs worked perfectly.	I have 3 ESP8266 units and tried flashing Espruino on all of them and had no luck.</p>		<p>My Os is Windows 10 Pro (64bit)</p>		<p>Symptoms:	I do not see any flashing errors. All flashing programs seems ends successfully.	Espruino IDE communications Baud rate is set to 115200.	At first connect from Espruino IDE, it says disconnected.	At second connect from IDE, it connects. But on the terminal prompt I cannot type anything. prompt does not accept any text.	I used PuTTY, still the same. I do not see a thing.

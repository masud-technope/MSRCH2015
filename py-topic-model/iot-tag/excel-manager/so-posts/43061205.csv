I have used an Arduino and Ethernet shield.</p>		<p>I'm able to create sensor data every second. It sends this data to the IoT hub directly from Arduino without a Raspberry Pi or PC|VS Studio. I have already created a job stream on Azure as well. Is there any mechanism with which I could send this data to Azure IoT hub directly? Thanks in advance.</p>	"

I imagine you can use both AMQP and also MQTT protocols for this directly from your Arduino. I'm using MQTT in my ESP8266's without VS involved, all written in the Arduino IDE. </p>	"

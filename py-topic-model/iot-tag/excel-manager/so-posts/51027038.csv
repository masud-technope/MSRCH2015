I already did this and i can communicate between the raspberry pi and the IoT Hub. I can send messages and store them in a Storage container.	But the biggest problem for me is to make the two devices communicate. My goal is that i send a message from the pi to the hub with a certain word, for example 'blue' and then the bulb changes its colour to blue. What is the best way to this? I really dont know how to proceed.</p>		<p>Help and advice would really be appreciated.</p>		<p>Greetings, Julian</p>	"

I searched for a lot of tutorials and tried out the logic app and some other things but i just cant get it working because it is such a new field for me. I am obviously missing some important feature but i just dont find it."

There are a few ways to do this:</p>		<ol>	<li>Use your Raspberry Pi as a controller by building a back-end application to control other devices.  You can find a tutorial on how to control other devices <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/quickstart-control-device-node" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.  You'd need to connect the Phillips hue bulb to IoT Hub as well.</li>	<li>Use your Raspberry Pi as an event triggering end-device, and use our <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-event-grid-routing-comparison" rel="nofollow noreferrer">integration features</a> to route the command and then sends the command to Phillips hue bulb using Microsoft Flow.  </li>	</ol>		<p>Our reference architecture is documented <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-iot-reference-architecture-update/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. </p>	"

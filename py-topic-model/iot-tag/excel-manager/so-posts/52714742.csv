Well, I would like my clients to access it without configuring their home routers with port forwarding. I am ready to buy AWS instance or any other suggested intermediate servers. Can anybody recommend how to do it? I see IP cameras implement a similar concept.</p>	"

You can find more information about EC2 instances [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/de_de/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html) and about elastic IP [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html)."

I use this IoT hub as input in Azure stream analytics. Then it should be filtered based on the deviceId via a query. I use PowerBI as output. In PowerBI I would like to make a line chart showing the temperature of the three devices. Currently, I use a PowerBI output for each device, which creates three datasets in PowerBI and unfortunately it is not possible to combine datasets.</p>		<p>Any suggestions?</p>		<p>For now I use this query</p>		<pre><code>WITH outputSander as(	    SELECT temp,deviceId,System.TIMESTAMP as time	    from Sensordata	    where deviceId = 'Raspberry_Pi_Sander'),	outputKoen as(	    SELECT temp,deviceId,System.TIMESTAMP as time	    from Sensordata	    where deviceId = 'Raspberry_Pi_Koen')	--outputLukas as(	  --  SELECT temp,deviceId,System.TIMESTAMP as time	   -- from Sensordata	   -- where deviceId = 'Raspberry_Pi_Lukas')	    select s1, s2	INTO	    [outputData]	FROM	    outputSander s1 LEFT JOIN outputKoen s2 on(DATEDIFF(s, s1, s2) BETWEEN 0 AND 5)	</code></pre>		<p>As output I would like to see something like this:</p>		<p>S1.temp S1.deviceId, S1.time, S2.temp, S2.deviceId, S2.time with their correct values respectively.</p>	"

If you have only 3 devices connected to the same IoT Hub, you could use something like 	`Select <your options> into <output> from <input>`	You'll get the output in the same dataset in PowerBI where you could plot a line graph of temp vs time."

In your case, there can be an extra field that can be used for a join.</p>		<p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2015/06/01/the-azure-stream-analytics-query-language/" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2015/06/01/the-azure-stream-analytics-query-language/</a></p>	"

It's automatically running mosquitto on port 1883 constantly and I realized now that my port was wrong but it still didn't fix anything.  I even tried to manually run mosquitto on another port and I couldn't connect to that either.  I set up a different server to mess around with and my Arduino was able to connect to that.  I think that it might have to do with firewall AWS' firewall settings"

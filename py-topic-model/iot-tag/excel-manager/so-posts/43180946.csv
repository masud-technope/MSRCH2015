Now, for some reasons, I need to use Maker service of IFTTT.com and needs to send message on topic created on CloudMQTT.</p>		<p>Problem is that Maker service only supports HTTP(s) end points and does not support MQTT, to my understanding. I am not able to find the HTTP(S) endpoint for CloudMQTT.com, which I can use in Maker service to connect both of them.</p>		<p>Any clue if connecting Maker and CloudMQTT is possible through any http(s) endpoint of CloudMQTT OR is it not doable ?</p>		<p>Thanks for your help.</p>	"

The only thing the CloudMQTT HTTP API handles is user management (<a href="https://www.cloudmqtt.com/docs-api.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.cloudmqtt.com/docs-api.html</a>) and I have not found anything else in the documentation that suggests you can publish to a CloudMQTT topic over HTTP.</p>		<p>What you need is a bridge between IFTTT and CloudMQTT which will take in an HTTP Post and spit out MQTT. That would be pretty easy to write but I think there are a few ready-made solutions out there. I haven't used it but Ponte (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ponte" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.eclipse.org/ponte</a>) looks promising. </p>		<p>For inspiration here is an approach using Home Assistant and Heroku to create an IFTTT to CloudMQTT (<a href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/28/http-to-mqtt-bridge/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/28/http-to-mqtt-bridge/</a>). However, you should be able to write a simple bridge and deploy it on Heroku... they even have a CloudMQTT add-on available (<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cloudmqtt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cloudmqtt</a>)... or something similar.</p>	"

The <code>ComponentName</code> constructor requires the package name of your app (not the package of the class), so your should look like this:</p>		<pre><code>val driverService = ComponentName(	        "com.example.neube.smartdrive",	        "com.example.neube.smartdrive.controlamotores.modooffline.DriverService"	)		val serviceIntent = Intent()	serviceIntent.component = driverService		// Bind to the driver service	bindService(serviceIntent, callback, BIND_AUTO_CREATE)	</code></pre>		<p>Note this format is really only necessary if you are calling a service in a remote process. Since you are binding to a service from within the same app context, it's much more straightforward to construct the intent this way:</p>		<pre><code>val serviceIntent = Intent(this, DriverService::class.java)	// Bind to the driver service	bindService(serviceIntent, callback, BIND_AUTO_CREATE)	</code></pre>	"

How to I can put application ModoAutomatico class in manifest.xml?	https://github.com/neuberfran/SmartDrive5/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml. I'm currently calling this Class on the MainActivity.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XqmHCtCwXniZf4ytwgJtMlZpL83t94FD/view?usp=sharing. What do you think about onCreate in DriverService.kt?"

This won't remove the "never used" warning from Studio, but the class will be instantiated automatically when the app launches. In your original screenshot, you had this correct in your manifest."

And furthermore: How can I set up time &amp; Region on my device?</p>		<p>Thank you so much for all helpfull and well meant answers.</p>	"

What I found was that you can edit the Pi's startup through Powershell on your PC and tell it what app to load.</p>		<p><em>Setting startup app:<br/>	Use the startup editor to configure startup apps on your Windows IoT Core device. Run Startup with any of the following options:<br/><br/>	Startup /d displays the list of startup apps.<br/><br/>	Startup /a [name] [path] adds an app with name name located at path path to the list of startup tasks.<br/><br/>	Startup /r [name] removes an app with name name from the list of startup tasks.<br/><br/>	For further help, try startup.exe /?</em><br/></p>		<p><a href="http://ms-iot.github.io/content/win10/tools/CommandLineUtils.htm">http://ms-iot.github.io/content/win10/tools/CommandLineUtils.htm</a></p>		<p>As far as region settings, you can do that while loading up the default screen on the Pi. When you get to the Windows screen, there is a gear icon in the lower right that will bring you there. Unfortunately, there isn't a real time clock built into the Raspberry Pi, so you'd have to add one (hardware) or pull it from the internet.</p>	"

Ah thanks, so I have to connect a mouse and Keyboard to the Pi to get to this Screen, I will try this today or tomorrow as well, thank you!"

My project's name was HelloWorld but it generated a totally different package name.</p>		<p>The name is a random guid and it is being deployed by that name. You can change that name at Project Properties screen.

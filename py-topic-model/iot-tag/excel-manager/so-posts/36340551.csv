I'll use an Arduino and a light sensor to acquire data and a remote app to do the processing and control. I could do this locally within Arduino or with a client/server app using my notebook. But I want to build my app on the cloud, receiving data from Arduino and sending back the action (i.e. increase or decrease light according to the amount of natural light).</p>		<p>What would be the best approach to building this? </p>	"

You'd be able to control your bulb using iOS, Android or even Windows phone.</p>		<p>In the Arduino, you just need to develop your sketch using the muzzley arduino library or a simple MQTT client. Regarding the interface, you can develop it with html/css/js in the website.</p>		<p>Besides controlling your bulb remotely, you can use it together with IoT devices available on market</p>		<p>You can find a similar integration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1HL9QZI-as" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>	"

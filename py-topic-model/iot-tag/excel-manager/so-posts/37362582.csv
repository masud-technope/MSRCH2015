I believe application layer need not do anything special to persist a TCP connection and MQTT is an application layer protocol. So, how does MQTT improvises in this area?</p>	"

With plain HTTP, it would require some kind of polling - using up a lot of power, even where there are no messages. With MQTT a message can be pushed to the client over the open TCP connection.</p>		<p>While there are lots of other protocols that allow this too. MQTT was designed for this purpose.</p>	"

MQTT has a keep alive message flowing between applications on top of the TCP connection, so that the applications can detect when the connection is broken, this allows the MQTT broker to reliably publish the (optional) client last will/testament when the connection is broken.</p>		<p>The article you read says that MQTT saves 50% mobile battery power compared to HTTPS, I think.</p>	"

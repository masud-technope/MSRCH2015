Then I would create a job to run this command but this doesn't seem to be right way to deal with this.</p>		<p>Is that possible? What should I do?</p>		<p><strong>EDIT</strong>	I already have some telemetry information being sent from my device to the cloud. If I was able to calculate the time past since the last message, I could create a rule (ex.: When time is greater than X) to fire an action.</p>	"

For example cloud device x will have telemetry 'HealthDeviceAtHomeA', if you able to reach device A from cloud device X you are sending telemetry  HealthDeviceAtHomeA = 100, otherwise HealthDeviceAtHomeA = 0 . Then for device x create a rule that will check average of HealthDeviceAtHomeA  for last 5 min and if it less then for example 50 you will alert. This will ensure connectivity and you can define different rules and logic as a number of your devices grows. If you have firewall restrictions then your home device can report its health to virtual health device.</p>	"

I know that I can keep firing an Azure Function through a job to do that but I don't think this is best way to do it."

Example: define event connected and send this event very 30 seconds. create a count event rule for last 10 minutes and if count fill be less than 10 trigger an action. Please note that rules are firing when there is some data for specified interval, so once it has been fired there will be a point when you will have no data for specified window of time and rule will not be evaluated. I didn't tried it myself but it should work"

The telemetry is exported to an event hub and Stream Analytics checks if a device stops sending telemetry.</p>		<p>It seems you can't do this in IoT Central without exporting the data somehow.</p>	"

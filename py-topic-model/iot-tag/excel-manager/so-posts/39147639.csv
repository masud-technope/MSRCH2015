All you need to know are a couple of credentials. You can either obtain those by reading the VCAP_SERVICES JSON property which can be injected into your container:</p>		<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2015/07/simplifying-distributed-docker-applications/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a> explaining this.

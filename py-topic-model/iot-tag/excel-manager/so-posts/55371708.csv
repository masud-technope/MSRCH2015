This means configuring the firewall to take any traffic that arrives on port 8888 and forwarding it to the broker machine and doing the reverse with any response traffic. Assuming you are on Windows then you would use the <code>netsh</code> command. See this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11525703/port-forwarding-in-windows">question</a> for details. This should work for both Native MQTT and MQTT over Websockets. If you are already using port forwarding from your router to the machine running ISS then you need to set up the port forwarding to the broker in the router, not the Windows machine.</p></li>	<li><p>If you are using MQTT over Websockets then you can configure ISS to act as a reverse proxy. This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34316825/websockets-reverse-proxy-in-iis-8">question</a> explains how to do that.</p></li>	</ol>	"

For no 2 , it uses (localhost) meaning by that it's internal network. For make it clear I have a hardware connected to internet by wifi and it's far far away. There's no internal network with my iot/mqtt server/broker. I want my hardware can send data to live mqtt or ws protocol. By that I need to make my internal thing open up to the public. So, everyone can access it from far. iot.ubidots.com for example. It's a way like vpn thing for hardware access internal/local network from far, not LAN"

Postings on this site are not notes to yourself; if you are going to raise this on a public QA site, you need to be clear about what problem you are asking about and how your answer solves it, not just post a list of steps in mystery context."

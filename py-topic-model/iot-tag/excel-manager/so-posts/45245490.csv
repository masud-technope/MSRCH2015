I followed a tutorial: <a href="https://github.com/farukc/AzureIoTHub-TI-CC3200" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/farukc/AzureIoTHub-TI-CC3200</a>, but this one is using CodeComposer which is not available for Mac OS. I run the CC3200 project in Energia, but on Serial Monitor Terminal I received a weird coded message: </p>		<blockquote>	  <p>zÒrZzXBH(úXX{ÿFRBXþÂ@ÞXJJ,</p>	</blockquote>		<p>and I have no idea what's going on. </p>	"

Except I have not found any way to make it connect to the two ESPs at the same time. </p>		<p>Is it possible to connect to multiple clients simultaneously using this library? If not, is running two separate python scripts both using this library at the same time a good idea? Could I even make those two scripts communicate with each other?</p>	"

While it was easy to send commands from Edison to Arduino, the direction from Arduino to Edison seems to be a big problem. So my robot does exactly what it should if I send "movement commands" to the Arduino so this way seems to work nicely. On the Arduino I echo each command and this echo doesn't reach the Edison.</p>		<p>So I hooked up my logic analyzer and all I get are frame errors.</p>		<p>I changed the Arduino sketch to send "Hello Chris" when turning it on. If I have a look at the Serial port without the Edison all is good and it correctly decodes the "Hello Chris". If however I plug in the UART connection, I only record frame errors. </p>		<p>What could be the problem?</p>	"

Eventually I'll do a test overseas if I find some time. Just to let you know that I'll investigate this and come back with some new data. Will have to demo an extremely stripped down version of my project."

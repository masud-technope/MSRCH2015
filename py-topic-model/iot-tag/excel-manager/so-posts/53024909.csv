But it is not clear which sequence is best when sending a UDP packet.</p>		<p>So, I know the order of commands is following:</p>		<pre><code>AT+CIICR        Brings up wireless connection	AT+CIFSR        Get local IP address	AT+CIPSTART     Establishes a connection with a server.	AT+CIPSEND      Sends data when the a connection is established.	AT+CIPCLOSE	</code></pre>		<p>OK but I need to send datagrams time-to-time. Say, the period is from minutes to hour.</p>		<p>I see that AT+CIICR can return ALREADY CONNECTED for subsequent calls, and I guess I should not call it more than once.	So the question is: which sequence should be used for the next datagrams?:</p>		<p>1)</p>		<pre><code>AT+CIPSTART	AT+CIPSEND	AT+CIPCLOSE	</code></pre>		<p>or just:</p>		<p>2)</p>		<pre><code>AT+CIPSEND	</code></pre>		<p>and AT+CIPCLOSE somewhere before a modem shutdown.</p>		<p>Is there any time-to-live of AT+CIPSTART state?	What is the best practice?</p>	"

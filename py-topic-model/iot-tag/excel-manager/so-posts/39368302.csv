My questions are as follows:</p>		<ol>	<li><p>In scenario 1: Let's say I need to connect only one thing to the Bluemix platform, so I configure the device type, device, authentication token, etc., to connect the device to the platform. This is possible in the current situation.</p></li>	<li><p>In scenario 2: If I need to connect 50 things to my platform, will I be configuring each and every device to get the device ID, token, etc.?</p></li>	</ol>		<p>Does Bluemix provide any discovery mechanism or other ways to configure things automatically?</p>	"

You may be able to create a "gateway" that uses CoAP to gather the info from other devices but only the gateway using MQTT would be able to communicate directly to the Watson IoT Platform."

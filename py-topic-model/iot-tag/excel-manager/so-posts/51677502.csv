I have found lots of documentation online, such as:</p>		<p><a href="https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/create-dashdb-data-warehouse-for-reporting-on-elevator-device-data/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/create-dashdb-data-warehouse-for-reporting-on-elevator-device-data/</a></p>		<p>But I'm not sure this will apply since I'm not using the same services. Essentially what I want to do is store rows of data in my Db2 instance on the Cloud. Is this as simple as connecting a Cloud Foundry application to respond to new events from IoTP and writing them to the database? Or is there a simpler method?</p>	"

If you have an application that is registered to listen to IOT events, then that app could be writing to a Db2 database. </p>	"

In this case the database is Cloudant, but the code in this sample could be easily modified to write to any database with minimal modification:</p>		<p>Specifically see <code>myEventCallback()</code> method: <a href="https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/connector-cloudant/blob/master/connector/connector-cloudant.py#L71" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/connector-cloudant/blob/master/connector/connector-cloudant.py#L71</a></p>		<p>For every event received by the application that method is invoked.  Rewrite that method to replace the write to Cloudant with a write to db2 (e.g. using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ibm_db/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ibm_db</a> module) and you are already half way there.</p>	"

I have verified it on my raspberry pi 2 with IoT Core 14393.</p>		<p>Alternatively, there's an <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/tree/master/csharp/device/samples/UWPSample" rel="nofollow noreferrer">UWP sample</a> app from azure-iot-sdk github repo, note that you'll need to reference "Windows.Azure.Devices.Client" instead of "Windows.Azure.Devices.Client.WinRT". It also works with my rapberry pi 2.</p>	"

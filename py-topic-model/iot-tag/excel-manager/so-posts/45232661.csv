Do IoT devices have some unique traffic characteristics, traffic pattern or identification (eg. protocols, ports, etc)? I can't find the answer. IoT devices are relatively new so there is not that much documentation about it.</p>		<p>Thanks!</p>	"

They will contact the site of their vendors for updates, send and receive data that directly relates to their function and won't have much variance in their behavior.</li>	<li>Watch for service discovery protocols. Many protocols include the service that the device gives as field. Read about ssdp and mdns.</li>	</ol>		<p>There are many more complex ways of using the fact that most of the communication is pre-defined. Devices have unique patterns of communication - like specific times between requests for example.</p>	"

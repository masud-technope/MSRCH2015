I am using ActionCable to manage websocket connections between my app and Arduino devices. The Arduino's are hardwired to ping into the app and join the websocket channel. In development, it is easy because I tell my server to listen to outside requests and the Arduinos ping localhost:3000. Now that I am trying to deploy, I realized it's tricky to manage this in production. </p>		<p>I would like a user to log in and see a list of smart devices in their home, the same way that many market ready devices work. If my app is on Heroku, is there a way I can configure the Rails app to look for incoming requests that share the same WiFi network as the current user? Otherwise, I would need to set up a form on the Arduinos where users would have to input their login credentials for the app to associate devices to users, but from a user experience perspective that would be a pain.</p>	"

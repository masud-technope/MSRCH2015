The STM32F4 inside the module will have an immutable, closed source ROM bootloader but it's not clear that would be in use.  If there's a custom bootloader in flash you'd first need to identify it.  Generally questions seeking to find an off-site resource aren't a fit here.   As a piece of advice, you *definitely* want to bring out the SWD pins to where you can connect an ST-LINK with a header and also spring pins for production, and you probably want a UART, too, *even* if your product is intended to be USB."

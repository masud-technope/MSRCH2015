I am trying to minimize the transmit power. The noise power is -168dBm/Hz. The BW is 180Khz and the transmit frequency is 2.4GHz. I have a minimum requirement for the SNR. </p>		<p>Upon solving I am getting a transmit power in range of -60 dBm to -70dBm. 	Is the transmit power feasible considering the noise is too less and the path loss is minimal considering a room size of 10m, i.e, the max distance between transmitter and receiver is 10m.</p>	"

With the text message I only want to receive the temperature. The current query string is:</p>		<pre><code>SELECT * FROM '$aws/things/MyDashButton/shadow/update'	</code></pre>		<p>I am assuming that I have to change the star to Temperature, but when I do the text message I receive is blank. I tried looking through the documentation, but cannot find an answer for this.</p>		<p>EDIT:</p>		<p>If I use </p>		<pre><code>SELECT state.desired.Temperature FROM '$aws/things/MyDashButton/shadow/update'	</code></pre>		<p>I get {"Temperature": 4} is there a way just to get the value?</p>	"

Use the Rule Engine to invoke the Lambda function. </p>	"

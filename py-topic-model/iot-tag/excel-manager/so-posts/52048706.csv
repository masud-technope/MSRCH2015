I want to force all communication of the IoT client to go to the server first. Right now, I am connecting the 2 via socket io but when i run a http request code on the IoT to google, the device does not communicate through the server but straight to google. How do I prevent this. Do i change the wifi connection between the IoT and server to something else?</p>	"

Im using a raspberry pi as my client, to configure the http proxy server as the default path for any requests my device is doing,  do I have to configure the iptables of my device, or write a script that whenever the device sends a message the destination ip is changed to the proxy server?"

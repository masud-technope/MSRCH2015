I'm interested in using UL2.0 via http, so <a href="https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-IoTAgent-Cplusplus/" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-IoTAgent-Cplusplus/</a> should be the place to go.</p>		<p>There I find RPMs are an option under <a href="https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-IoTAgent-Cplusplus/blob/develop/doc/deploy.md#def-rpms" rel="nofollow">Deployment/Using RPMs</a>, but I can't find the RPMs, only the instructions on how to build them.</p>		<p>Aren't there RPMs available for IDAS? Only building from source? Perhaps each OS instance needs its own build.</p>		<p>Thank you</p>	"

It's a good placement. I couldn't find it because there aren't other references to it, but its there.</p>		<p>Also, building from source is recomended.</p>	"

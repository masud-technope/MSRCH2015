I have a Raspberry Pi and am trying to write a simple Python program to print the temperature and humidity data to the log. I have a DHT11 sensor plugged into 3V3, ground, and the data connected to GPIO pin 14. Here is the code I have so far:</p>		<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python		from gpiozero import InputDevice		print(InputDevice(14, False))	</code></pre>		<p>However, all this prints is:</p>		<pre><code>&lt;gpiozero.InputDevice object on pin GPIO14, pull_up=False, is_active=False&gt;	</code></pre>		<p>I'm not sure if it was wrong to use 'InputDevice' or really which direction to go from here. I just want to be able to read the temp and humidity. Thank you for any advice.</p>	"

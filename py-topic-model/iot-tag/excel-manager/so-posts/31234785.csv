It's really easy to trigger something from the raspberry pi, you just curl the given event url and then you trigger your action. The other way around is a bit more complicated for me.	<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/06fog.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.stack.imgur.com/06fog.jpg</a></p>		<p>So I tried set up a server with WebIOPI, which works great but not really for what I planned for. It basically connects with your weaved.com account. What do you think what would be an easy and stable efficient way to trigger my gpios with ifttt?</p>	"

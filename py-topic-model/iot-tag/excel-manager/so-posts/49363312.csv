It's supposed to read the voltage value from my NodeMCU device and display it. I think the values should be transmitted to ThingSpeak database channels and I did that just fine. But I can't find one single tutorial on how to read back the values in ThingSpeak on my Android application in all the articles about Bluetooth communication between Arduino and the smartphone, I was wondering how to do that with internet connection. I need a simple example on how to send a sensor data to ThingSpeak and show it on my android application..</p>	"

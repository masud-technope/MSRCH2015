I've not found anything that mentions a limit, so I'm assuming not.</p>	"

I ask as I'm assuming that I'd need a Group for every core device I have out in the field.  I don't think there is a limit as nothing is mentioned in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_greengrass"

After installing it onto your account it allows you to provision Greengrass group and associated resources (cores, function definitions, resources, loggers, etc.) from a CloudFormation stack.

For that you should use one of the AWS IoT SDKs like Python (Boto) along with correct authentication and authorization, more information about python SDK for Greengrass can be found <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/greengrass.html?highlight=greengrass#Greengrass.Client.create_subscription_definition" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.

I ran my server using <code>python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000</code> so that it is accessible from any devices that are connected to my WiFi. </p>		<p>Any computers or smartphones in my network can simply go to my computer's IP Address <code>192.168.0.0:8000</code> via their browser to see my Django page.</p>		<p>I would like to use an ESP8266 module to send a GET request to the locally hosted Django page. The following AT Commands are used.</p>		<pre><code>AT+CWMODE=1	AT+CWJAP="SSID","PASS"	AT+CIPMUX=1	AT+CIPSTART=0,"TCP","192.168.0.0",80  &lt;--Problem arise here, hence I could not move on with my GET request	</code></pre>		<p>All but the last command was executed successfully. When I run the last AT Command to establish a TCP connection with my local server, I get an error.</p>		<pre><code>ERROR	0,CLOSED	</code></pre>		<p>Currently, I'm still not super proficient with networks and backend. Any long explanation and/or answers will be well appreciated!  </p>	"

I could see that the connected DualShock was correctly enumerated because it logged the <code>\\?\HID#VID_054C&amp;PID_05C4...</code>.</p>		<p>So naturally the next thing I wanted to do was opening the device for communication. Since it is an HID I was using the <code>HidDevice</code> class with <code>var device = await HidDevice.FromIdAsync(args.Id, FileAccessMode.ReadWrite);</code>. Sadly the returned <code>device</code> is always null, nothing on the screen is prompted or so.</p>		<p>Next I assumed there at least has to be some kind of USB interface accessible so I went for <code>var device = await UsbDevice.FromIdAsync(args.Id);</code></p>		<p>But now I am getting <code>A device attached to the system is not functioning. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007001F)</code> or sometimes also <code>The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.</code></p>		<p>How can I talk to my device? :(</p>	"

About industry standard HID usage, see the Universal Serial Bus (USB) specification [HID Usage Tables](http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage#HID_Usage). Beside there is vendor-defined."

With libhid i just give the vendor and product ID both of which i am aware of, but whatever usage id/type i try in windows 10 IoT it tells me there is no device. I would gladly tell it those two values, but I just dont know them. Is there a way to figure it out?"

The idea is to publish the same topic into two different MQTT servers with python. I mean, something like this:</p>		<pre><code>import paho.mqtt.client as paho	import datetime, time		mqttc = paho.Client()		host1 = "broker.hivemq.com" # the address of 1st mqtt broker	host2 = "192.168.1.200" # the address of 2nd mqtt broker	topic= "testingTopic"	port = 1883		def on_connect(mosq, obj, rc):	   print("on_connect() "+str(rc))		mqttc.on_connect = on_connect		print("Connecting to " + host)	mqttc.connect(host1, port, 60)	mqttc.connect(host2, port, 60)		while 1:	    # publish some data at a regular interval	    now = datetime.datetime.now()	    mqttc.publish(topic, now.strftime('%H:%M:%S')) #Publishing to MQTT1	    mqttc.publish(topic, now.strftime('%H:%M:%S')) #Publishing to MQTT2	    time.sleep(1)	</code></pre>		<p>So, the question is about the while statment... how can I do to publish the same topic into MQTT1 and MQTT2? 	As you can see, I want to have to posibility to publish that payload in MQTT broker that is running in internet, but if I lose internet connection, then I can pub/sub to MQTT broker in my LAN.</p>	"

You need 2 separate instances of the of the client that you connect to the separate brokers.</p>		<pre><code>...	mqttc1 = paho.Client()	mqttc2 = paho.Client()	...	mqttc1.connect(host1, port, 60)	mqttc2.connect(host2, port, 60)	...	mqttc1.publish(topic, now.strftime('%H:%M:%S')) #Publishing to MQTT1	mqttc2.publish(topic, now.strftime('%H:%M:%S')) #Publishing to MQTT2	</code></pre>	"

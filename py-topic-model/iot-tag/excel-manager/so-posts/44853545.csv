So as soon as you stringify your object it should be displayed correctly. Insert in the function node the following code:    </p>		<pre><code>msg.payload = {'d' : {'temp' : JSON.stringify(msg.payload)}}; return msg;	</code></pre>		<p>transform object into String: </p>		<pre><code>JSON.stringify(obj);	</code></pre>	"

I tried: `msg.payload = {'d' : {'temp' : JSON.stringify(msg.payload)}}; return msg;` as well as `msg.payload=JSON.stringify(msg.payload); msg.payload = {'d' : {'temp' : msg.payload}}; return msg; `"

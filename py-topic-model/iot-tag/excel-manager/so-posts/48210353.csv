The request, if it were made directly to Garmin's API server, needs to be signed (OAuth1) and according to the HealthAPI docs, it is a GET, not a POST.</p>		<p>Most importantly, the CURL request goes to a local PHP server, not to Garmin.  I have no idea of what's running at that server, so there's no way to debug this further.  The Garmin address is in the JSON data payload, but curl is POSTing this payload to <a href="http://mysite/testping.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://mysite/testping.php</a></p>		<p>I would suggest starting by sending requests directly to the Garmin API server, if possible, using a tool like Postman to make sure that the request is correctly formed, signed for OAuth v1, etc.</p>	"

Documentation provides the way of getting list-things using AWS CLI, how can i achieve the same using rest-api ?</p>	"

After importing that sdk to your solution, you can query like this :</p>		<pre><code>var iot = new AWS.Iot({	            "accessKeyId":"accessKeyId",	            "secretAccessKey":"secretAccessKey",	            "region":"region"	            });		            iot.listThings({}, function(err, data) {	            if (err) console.log(err, err.stack); // an error occurred	              else     console.log(data);           // successful response	            });	</code></pre>		<p>You can find the API documentation <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Iot.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>	"

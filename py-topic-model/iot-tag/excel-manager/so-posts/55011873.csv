In some cases, the data must be sent to another device. Currently, I have a C# console application that does the job. It subscribes to my Iot Hub and reads the data from my partitions. As far as I understood, there must be an Azure component that should be used instead of a console application. My question is, what component can be used in order to receive data from an IoT device in order to process the data?</p>		<p>Thanks in advance!</p>	"

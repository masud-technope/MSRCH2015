I have used nginx and puma for deployment of my app.Basically, I want to record all data sent by IoT device and store that data in one table.IoT device is using TCP for communication with server. so I have used <code>stream</code> directive of nginx to communicate with device and I want to transfer the tcp request to puma for processing purpose. Puma is only accepting http requests, so it raises following error.</p>		<pre><code> HTTP parse error, malformed request : #&lt;Puma::HttpParserError: Invalid HTTP format, parsing fails.&gt;	</code></pre>		<p>I have confiured nginx.conf file like below</p>		<pre><code>    stream {	    log_format  main  '$time_iso8601 $remote_addr'	                      '$protocol  $status $bytes_sent $bytes_received '	                      '$session_time $upstream_addr '	                      '"$upstream_bytes_sent" "$upstream_bytes_received" "$upstream_connect_time"';		    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;		    server {	        listen port;	        proxy_pass app;	    }		    upstream app {	        server path of puma.sock;	    }	}	</code></pre>	"

For my program I need to use the Boost C++ Libraries, is this libraries compatible with Win10 IoT Core ? At the same time, I've linked Boost to Visual Studio 2015 but I've an error when cross-compiling : "LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'libboost_regex-vc140-mt-gd-1_63.lib'"</p>		<p>Need help please.</p>		<p>Thanks,</p>		<p>Azm0g.</p>	"

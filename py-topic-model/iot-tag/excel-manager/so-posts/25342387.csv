I can connect to wifi networks using Yocto.</p>		<p>But the latest Windows image doesn't have drivers for my wifi card, I tried to install the drivers with pnputil and dpinst commands but Windows says both commands doesn't exists.</p>		<p>Also I revised the list of Windows services and "Wifi AutoConfig" isn't on the list, then I tried to set wlan settings using netsh but netsh don't have wlan settings.</p>		<p>So because I wasn't able to install drivers and there are not wireless services and settings I think wifi is not supported in the latest Windows image for Galileo.</p>	"

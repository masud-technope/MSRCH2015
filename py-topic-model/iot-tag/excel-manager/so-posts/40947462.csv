I want to know what kind of motors I should look for! (google talks about servo motor / potentio motor, etc.). I want to listen from experts on this.</p>		<p>It is an IoT exercise I am working on with my software knowledge. I have Arduino Uno kit, but I can use a better / different one if needed.</p>		<p>I need suggestion on motors (different strengths), their precise control and a way to confirm the action completion.</p>	"

And also can you share any details about torque needed to rotate a fan controller and a door handle? Any tools to measure this?"

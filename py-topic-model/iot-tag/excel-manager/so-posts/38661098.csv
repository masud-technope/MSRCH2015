When people come into/leave the room, sensors react on this action. So, after some time, dataset will look like that:</p>		<pre><code>&lt;sensor_1&gt; &lt;sensor_2&gt; ... &lt;sensor_i&gt; &lt;time&gt; | &lt;people in room?&gt;	   ...         ...           ...       ...         yes/no	</code></pre>		<p>In this way, how should I address this problem? Should I take into consideration previous readings from sensors and due to this use time-series techniques or LSTM? Can I simply apply SVM or neural net for this task?</p>	"

I would start with a simple window-based approach (to recognize deltas in *humidity* and *temperature*). It might be a good idea to convert these two features to a delta-value. On top of this a simple SVM should be enough. Of course one has to decide on the window-size. Besides that, the general approach by @JohnYetter sounds good. Start simple and iterate"

You should start with a simple tool, like logistic regression, SVM or Random Forests. Usually, starting with a quick and dirty model and iterating beats worrying overmuch about algorithms ahead of the time. If you need a more complicated model, you will discover that, if you iterate."
38661098,64729533,38661098,3,1,Sat Jul 30 14:16:00 EDT 2016,721810,"I agree with John and Sascha that an SVM should do the job.  This is my favorite classifier for this type of problem.  I don't believe you need to consider time.  You haven't stated whether or not you will be labeling your training data.  That is a critical step."

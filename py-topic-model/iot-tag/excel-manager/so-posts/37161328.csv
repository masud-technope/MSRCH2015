This is a known bug and is being fixed. If that's why you're asking the question, keep that in mind :) .</p>		<p>To actually answer your question: snaps installed from the store are automatically updated when a new version is published in the store, in the same channel. Period. It's super easy-- you shouldn't need to do anything. To make this more clear, let's walk through an example.</p>		<p>Say you had snap <code>foo</code>, built with Snapcraft as <code>foo_1_amd64.snap</code>. You can run <code>snapcraft upload</code> to upload it to the store, or you can do it yourself by visiting <a href="http://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/" rel="nofollow">MyApps</a>. Once it passes the automated review, you can publish it into one or more channels (the one used by Snappy by default is <code>stable</code>, so that should contain your stable releases).</p>		<p>Now you can run <code>sudo snap install foo</code> and it'll install your newly published snap, version 1. Ignoring the known issue outlined above, if you publish another version of the <code>foo</code> snap in the same channel, you'll notice that eventually the installed <code>foo</code> is updated to the new version. I say "eventually" since updates are randomly staggered throughout the day.</p>	"

Automatic updates apply system-wide (including non-ubuntu-core components), but whether or not automatic updates are ENABLED system-wide is controlled via the configuration of the ubuntu-core snap. Does that make sense? Note also that `snappy config` does not currently exist on the desktop-- something that will be added soon."
37161328,61890142,37167614,3,0,Thu May 12 05:34:00 EDT 2016,3205850,"that answer really helps. one more doubt i have after referring autoupdate @ https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/guides/autoupdate/ is that, whether the setting on autoupdate impacts automatic updates to the snaps installed from store or is it only applicable to ubuntu-core components."

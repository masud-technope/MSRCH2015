When I try to run the trigger in the logic app it gives me a pop-up saying "When_a_message_is_received_in_a_queue". When I run the logic app it says the work flow has timed out after a couple of minute.</p>		<p>I copied what this guy done except when he sends the emails I added a twilio connector. </p>		<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-monitoring-notifications-with-azure-logic-apps" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-monitoring-notifications-with-azure-logic-apps</a></p>		<p>The messages that I am sending from my device to my IOT hub are being received by stream analytics, is it possible that stream analytics is stopping the messages from being fed to the service bus? The input to stream analytics is a data stream. </p>		<p>Thanks for any help and sorry if this is a silly question.</p>	"

That would help narrow down the problem to either IoTHub -> ASA pipeline -> Service Bus pipeline or Service Bus -> Logic App.</p>	"

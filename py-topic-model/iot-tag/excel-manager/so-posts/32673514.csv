My initial goal is to get a small WIFI IOT project like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU76yWHeQuw" rel="nofollow">Initial goal video</a></p>		<p>Till now the only thing I was able to achieve was getting it flashed (<a href="https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher" rel="nofollow">nodeMCU Flasher</a>) to the latest lua nodemcu firmware(<a href="https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware" rel="nofollow">nodeMCU Firmware</a>) via FTDI board. After flashing, I tried using the IDE for ESP8266 (<a href="http://esp8266.ru/esplorer/" rel="nofollow">ESPlorer</a>) and see if I can get it to show me the uploaded firmware. But every time it just showed gibberish data (checked with all the baud rates).</p>		<p>I even tried using Arduino after updating the latest firmware using the bare minimum sketch, but it again showed gibberish data (again checked with all the baud rates). I checked online multiple videos and tried each of them, but nothing works. To keep a standard discussion, I was following this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh_pgqjfeQc" rel="nofollow">video</a>.</p>		<p>The setup I am using is,	- FTDI232 board with 3.3v output as an input to ESP	I read that FTDI can only supply enough juice to upload the firmware, but what I am able to see is the FTDI 3.3v output supply gives 6v (open load)? Is this possible? The ESP works perfectly well at this voltage as I can see the red led glowing bright and blue LED flashing on first power ON. No heat nothing.	- I then used Regulated power supply 3.3V, but with this the ESP power Red LED was quite dim and blue LED never even flashed. </p>		<p>I have 5 ESP8266 board, tried with 3 of them. All having the same issue. So for sure I am missing something. Can anyone help me understand what I am doing wrong?   </p>	"

32673514,53286791,32673514,3,0,Tue Sep 22 16:31:00 EDT 2015,4160251,"I did disconnect GPIO0 from ground. I switched off the supply and restarted. Is this what you mean by reset? If yes, I already did that. But if not, than I might have to try the other method of resetting. Can you please tell me how to do that?"
32673514,53281682,32673514,3,0,Tue Sep 22 14:31:00 EDT 2015,3102264,"Perhaps are you still in flashing mode ? After flashing you should disconnect GPIO0 from ground, and reset the ESP."
32673514,53347060,32673514,3,0,Thu Sep 24 04:41:00 EDT 2015,4160251,"Flasher is giving me green signal once the firmware upgrade was finish. The log also says success on each line. So I am pretty sure the firmware was successfully updated. The only thing I am not able to work around with is the step after upgrading the firmware. I can't make it communicate using Sketch or ESPlorer. And I don't have any other thing connected during serial communication when I am working with ESP."
32673514,53288756,32673514,3,0,Tue Sep 22 17:24:00 EDT 2015,3102264,"Yes this is what I mean, you could also connect briefly RST to ground. So perhaps firmware writing failed. Is there something in the log ? During firmware write, ESPlorer or esptool use the serial port, then you should not have other program like minicom/picocom connected to the serial during this phasis."

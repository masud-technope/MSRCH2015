(Devices are of different companies, not my own inbuilt i.e. like MI, Syska, Philips hue etc).</p>		<p>Here are my 2 doubts:</p>		<p>1). Is there any way that I can directly communicate with LED strip via zigbee without communicating with Yeelight servers.</p>		<p>2). If not possible then, I want to make my own android and iOS application that will call the Alexa APIs to control all the devices (My question is which APIs I need to call)</p>		<p>Any kind of help is appreciated.</p>	"

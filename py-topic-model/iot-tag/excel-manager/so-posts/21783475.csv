I've been working on the Home Automation business for 7 years now, and so far I've only worked with apps that were developed by the manufacturers of this Home Automation systems; now I'm trying to develop something on my own.</p>		<p>The DSC 1832 Panel uses a communication module called DSC IT-100 which allows the system to receive and send HEX commands (RS232) in order to be controlled. The idea is to have a TCP/IP to RS232 device that can help me send and receive these commands from my device while connected to my network, the device I'm planning on using is Global Cache IP2SL.</p>	"

Did you come across the open source project <a href="https://github.com/taligentx/dscKeybusInterface" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DSC Keybus Interface</a>? At a glance this looks promising to me as it claims to provide a library directly interfaces Arduino and esp8266 microcontrollers to DSC PowerSeries security systems for integration with home automation, notifications on system events, and usage as a virtual keypad. If the library is applicable for what you're trying to achieve you can get it possibly done without doing a lot of coding yourself. However, it requires some basic understanding how to program microcontrollers and you'd need to wire it.</p>		<p>Using a generic "RS-232 to TCP/IP converter" like the one you mentioned would require a significant develop effort for the application unless there are existing applications for this (which I did not find).</p>	"

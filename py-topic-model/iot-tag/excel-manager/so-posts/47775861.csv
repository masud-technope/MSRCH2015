Which unfortunately has not worked yet. I can not hang in, on any event that gives me the opportunity to accept the pairing request of the android device!	The same goes for the unpairing. </p>		<p>I get the 	<code>ActivationKind.DevicePairing</code> via the <code>OnActivated (IActivatedEventArgs args)</code>	 However, I can't find data in der to accept the pairing.</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3jpTD.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pairing process</a></p>		<p>In the examples I have seen so far, the pairing starts allways from a win 10 iot device, which works! But I need it the opposite way.</p>		<p>Thanks for any help</p>	"

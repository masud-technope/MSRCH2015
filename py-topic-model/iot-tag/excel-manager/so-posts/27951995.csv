Most IoT Solutions I've looked at so far (electric imp, Spark core) explicitly state that they cannot connect to a captive portal. I've seen other higher-level code for automatically interacting with a captive portal but I have not found a solution that allows an embedded wifi device (like the CC3000) to automatically accept terms on a captive portal. </p>		<p>Has anyone seen or built a custom wifi stack for something like the CC3000 that can recognize and interact with a captive portal? is there another embedded wifi solution (xbee wifi maybe?) that has had success in this area?</p>	"

I would go for a high-level code executed automatically after connecting to the network. Some simple script for example which automatically "presses the UI button" for you. Depending on the design of that page this may be as simple as a single http-request.</p>		<p>Another solution (maybe): Depending on the Wifi-Modules you've chosen the MAC-Addresses of your devices are predicable. Maybe the network admins can add a rule to their config to allow these devices on their guest network without the need of that captive portal.</p>	"

Most of the hardware devices I've seen won't connect to a network if there is a captive portal. They connect to the wifi, then can't get to the internet and determine that the network is not live, then they fail. I'm not sure when we would get the change to run such a script or execute a http-request without building into the hardware firmware."

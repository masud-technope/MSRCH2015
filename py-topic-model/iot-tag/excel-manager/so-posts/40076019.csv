I read somewhere that it is a component based billing based on the CPU/hour, number of input/output requests, etc.,</p>		<p>How are the I/O requests interpreted? I have a model in which I am trying to reduce the number of input queries that go into the cloud. Will it reduce my yearly cost to a good extent?</p>	"
40076019,67425325,40076019,3,1,Sun Oct 16 22:20:00 EDT 2016,13070,"You "read somewhere"? How about sticking with the official documentation on this subject: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/pricing/  Note how it is $0.20 per million requests. You'd have to be making billions of requests each month in order to be spending much money at all on RDS requests."

It involves:</p>		<ul>	<li>An hourly charge for the <strong>RDS instance</strong></li>	<li>A charge for <strong>data storage</strong> based on amount of storage (including backup storage beyond the provisioned storage size)</li>	<li>A <strong>Data Transfer</strong> for traffic flowing out of AWS to the Internet</li>	<li>A minor charge for traffic flowing between Availability Zones</li>	</ul>		<p>There are <strong>no charges relating to database requests</strong>. In fact, these requests are directly between client apps and the database and are not visible to AWS.</p>		<p><strong>Update:</strong> Amazon Aurora also charges an "I/O request" charge.

I couldn't find a definition of that, although I found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6926600/how-does-amazon-rds-calculate-i-o-rate but that's not definitive."

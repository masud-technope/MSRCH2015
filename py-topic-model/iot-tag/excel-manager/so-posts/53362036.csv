Here is the github <a href="https://github.com/mwasilak/txThings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">repo</a>. In my sample project, the scripts are hosted to raspberry pi to control a device. I am successfully able to communicate with the sample script <a href="https://github.com/mwasilak/txThings/blob/master/examples/server.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">server.py</a> from CoAP client. But my requirement is to measure the elapsed time, memory and latency of sever.py when the request will be 10, 100 and 1000. I didn't get any solution to measure performance considering the above situation. This question may seem vague to someone, I apologize for that since I am a newbie to python.	Help is very much needed.	Thanks in advance.</p>	"

Microsoft provides <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-getstarted" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a tutorial for getting started with Azure IoT Hub in C#</a>, but unfortunately, I encountered a problem with the tutorial:</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p1vas.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p1vas.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>In the picture above, I have selected Microsoft.Azure.Device NuGet package for installation. I have tried version 1.0.0 and also the latest one available, 1.2.4. The projects were automatically generated by Unity and that is probably the reason, why I do encounter this problem. Which problem? After I try to install the selected NuGet, I encounter the following error:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>Could not install package 'Microsoft.Azure.Devices 1.2.4'. You are	  trying to install this package into a project that targets	  '.NETFramework,Version=v3.5,Profile=Unity Full v3.5', but the package	  does not contain any assembly references or content files that are	  compatible with that framework. For more information, contact the	  package author.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>I was like, "Hmm, I must have wrong .NET framework version. I wonder if I can change that..." I tried to go to project properties like this</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U6px4.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U6px4.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>Microsoft advises changing .NET framework from <strong>Properties</strong> context menu item:	<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/fi-fi/library/bb772098(v=vs.90).aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://technet.microsoft.com/fi-fi/library/bb772098(v=vs.90).aspx</a> (4.24.2017)	<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb398202(v=vs.100).aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb398202(v=vs.100).aspx</a> (4.24.2017)</p>		<p>However, this feature must be blocked by something, because the view that is supposed to open flashes white and disappears immediately. I suppose Unity doesn't like people tinkering with project properties, but what else can I do? Incompatible .NET framework issue needs to be resolved, so that the NuGet package can be installed, but how do I do that?</p>		<p>In short, <em>how to install Microsoft.Azure.Devices NuGet package for Unity?</em></p>	"

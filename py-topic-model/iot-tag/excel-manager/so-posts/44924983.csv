Please check out the image bellow.</p>		<p><img src="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/uploads/articles/Introduction-to-the-MQTT-Protocol-on-NodeMCU-(1).png" alt="MQTT-Broker  &lt;-&gt;  WebServer"></p>		<p>Is this a good way to save data from different sensors in a database? 	In the picture the WebServer which communicates with the database is an MQTT Client. The WebServer just subscribe too all topics via #. </p>		<p>Is this scalable? I mean if there are 100.000 sensors out there and all send messages to this one WebServer..?</p>	"

The only other option to a seperate client subscribed to <code>#</code> would be to use a broker like HiveMQ which has a plugin mechanism that can record all messages in a database.</p>		<p>Also <code>#</code> should probably be <code>sensors/#</code> in order to skip any other messages that may be on the system.</p>		<p>100,000 sensors isn't the deciding factor here, the rate at which these sensors deliver messages will be the important point as it will determine the actual load.</p>	"

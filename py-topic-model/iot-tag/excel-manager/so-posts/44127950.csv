The tag is already configured and holds some data, it's running as a GATT Server and is the peripheral. I have a Advertising service UUID I can scan for and connect to then read the characteristics once a bond is in place.</p>		<p>I would like to use the RPi running Android Things O/S to scan for the sensor tag, then connect and read the data from the sensor tag as it passes by. In a similar fashion to a mobile application.</p>		<p>When the sensor passes by for the first time, the user will be required to authorise the connection on the sensor tag by pressing a button. This should create a bond.</p>		<p>I can't see any examples if this scenario is possible or not. Typically, the use case is round the other way and the examples are of Android Things (RPi) running a GATT Server advertising it's services to a GATT Client.</p>		<p>I've been having a look at the documentation here, but not sure how this would work:	<a href="https://developer.android.com/things/reference/com/google/android/things/bluetooth/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.android.com/things/reference/com/google/android/things/bluetooth/package-summary.html</a></p>		<p>The example here seems to be the opposite of what I'm looking for with the GATT server running on the Android Things end:	<a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sample-bluetooth-le-gattserver" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/androidthings/sample-bluetooth-le-gattserver</a></p>	"

You can use the standard Android BLE APIs without any changes, so have a look at the existing <a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-BluetoothLeGatt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Android BluetoothLeGatt Sample</a>.</p>		<p>Additionally, if you find it helpful, I personally built an Android <a href="https://github.com/devunwired/accessory-samples/tree/master/BluetoothGatt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">BLE GATT sample</a> a few years back that talks specifically to the SensorTag. It was a previous version of the hardware, but the overall concepts should remain the same.</p>	"

In fact, we even added a few to work specifically with device profiles on Android Things: https://developer.android.com/things/reference/com/google/android/things/bluetooth/package-summary.html"

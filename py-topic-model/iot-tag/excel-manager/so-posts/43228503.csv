IBM has been active in linked-data IoT efforts: https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/content/architecture/iotArchitecture The basis for the linked data part is based on [OSLC](https://open-services.net/). If you are interested, shoot an email to the [public mailing list](https://open-services.net/mailman/listinfo) (probably, OSLC-AM is best)."

In order to run the sample, I used Casablanca 2.2:</p>		<ol>	<li><p>Since there doesn't appear to be a way to download the 2.3 source code from Codeplex, the only way I could see was to use Git:</p>		<p>git clone <a href="https://git01.codeplex.com/casablanca" rel="nofollow">https://git01.codeplex.com/casablanca</a> </p>		<p>git checkout 9cc7758d714b</p></li>	<li><p>At this point, you can follow the instructions in the Galileo sample to build cpprest120d_2_2.dll and copy it to the Galileo.  Be sure to set the "No Enhanced Instructions" option.</p></li>	<li><p>Create a new project for the sample as directed, <strong>but</strong> don't use NuGet to install cpprestsdk.  This will install the 2.3 version.  Instead, you want to include the 2.2 version you built earlier...</p></li>	<li><p>Add the casablanca120.vcxproj project from your Git folder to your solution</p></li>	<li><p>In your sample project, add a Reference to the Casablanca DLL project:   Project properties -> Common Properties -> References</p></li>	<li><p>Add the Casablanca 2.2 header folder to your sample project:  Project properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General.  Set the "Additional Include Directories" field to <em>your-casablanca-folder</em>\Release\include.</p></li>	</ol>		<p>That's it - build and run.</p>	"

To enable more diagnostic output, you can change registry key GlobalFlag=2 under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager.

This method is defined in User32.dll and if you compare User32.dll in you workstation Windows with the one in Galileo, youâ€™ll see that these files are pretty much different.</p>		<p>You can find out on my blog how I fixed/workarounded the problem <a href="http://kardum.net/iot/intel-galileo-windows-application-azure-storage/" rel="nofollow">http://kardum.net/iot/intel-galileo-windows-application-azure-storage/</a></p>	"

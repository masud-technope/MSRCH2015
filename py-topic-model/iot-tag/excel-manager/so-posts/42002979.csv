My understanding is that upon pairing, the device communicates to the app via specific path (Device --> Local Router --> Manufacturer Cloud --> App) and vice versa for app-device communication.</p>		<p>Why is there a Manufacturer Cloud in the path? Why can't it be Device --> Router --> Some random telecommunication line --> App? In other words, why is there a middleman in the cloud?</p>	"

My question that I've been scouring the internet for an answer, is WHY nearly every manufacturer of IoT systems (Nest, Hive, Phillips etc.) routes data communication packets through their cloud. Why can't the Phillips app for example, communicate STRAIGHT to the device? You just need to encrypt the packet locally, send the packet over a standard transport layer, and then receive on the other end.		Why is there a Philips cloud server in the middle?"

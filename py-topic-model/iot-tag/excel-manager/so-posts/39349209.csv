How can I copy files from a USB stick connected to the device to the local SD card storage? Is this possible using PowerShell?</p>		<p>Ideally I want to do this without the need for a UWP app running on the device and any interaction via a local GUI.</p>		<p>Currently when the device is running its default app and I insert a USB stick nothing happens like it does on a desktop edition of Windows 10.</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PnLKS.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PnLKS.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>To further clarify I also don't want to navigate to the devices storage via a UNC path copying files between network locations. The files have to be sourced from the USB stick.</p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

Like below.</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DLRS4.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DLRS4.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>Note; drives C, D and U are used by the device and system.</p>		<p>Then use a XCOPY in the PowerShell session once you know the drive letter your USB stick has been assigned. Eg. E above.</p>		<pre><code>XCOPY E:\ C:\Data\FromUSB\	</code></pre>		<p>This will copy everything from the root of the USB stick to a folder on the devices SD card called 'FromUSB' in the Data parent directory.</p>		<p>Note; creating custom folder on the root of the C drive may not appear to some UI's.</p>		<p>Hope this helps.</p>	"

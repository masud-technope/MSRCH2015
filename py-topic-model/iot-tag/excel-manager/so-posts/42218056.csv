My purpose is to allow the publisher to remove the published topic. Did I miss something in the mqtt document? Any suggestion? Thanks !</p>	"
42218056,71600965,42218056,3,0,Tue Feb 14 07:36:00 EST 2017,504554,"What do you mean by remove a topic, they are just addresses that messages are delivered to when published, there is nothing to remove. Or do you mean to remove a message with the retained bit set?"
42218056,71601865,42218056,3,0,Tue Feb 14 08:06:00 EST 2017,7040863,"I mean cancel the existed topic(address). For example, I published a topic weather/humidity with some messages. The subscriber subscribes this topic and receives the messages. I want to cancel this topic by the client. At this state, the subscriber still subscribing this topic but find out that this topic is gone. Thus, he receives no message."
42218056,42220926,42218056,2,1,Tue Feb 14 08:13:00 EST 2017,504554,"<p>There is no concept of removing a topic.</p>		<p>If the publisher stops publishing data on a topic the subscribers will stop receiving data on that topic but there is nothing to remove. A subscriber can subscribe to a topic that no messages have ever been published on and that is fine, the broker will send then any messages that may be sent in the future.</p>		<p>Pub/sub messaging topics are not like message queues that need to be defined up front</p>	"
42218056,71603688,42220926,3,1,Tue Feb 14 09:02:00 EST 2017,504554,"As I said there is no concept of removing a topic. Topics have virtually no overhead unless the broker is actively processing a message. If you mean queued high QOS messages for offline subscribers then that is broker dependent and most of the implementations that clean them up do so on a time based expirary basis."
42218056,71603753,42220926,3,0,Tue Feb 14 09:04:00 EST 2017,555111,"Take a look at this link for removing stored messages http://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-8-retained-messages (as answerer says, it is HiveMQ dependent...)"
42218056,71621597,42220926,3,1,Tue Feb 14 16:15:00 EST 2017,5612096,"Please do NOT pay attention to @Goufalite comment, retained messages is a completely different feature and has nothing to do with topics, his comment brings confussion"
42218056,71603072,42220926,3,0,Tue Feb 14 08:46:00 EST 2017,7040863,"Thank you so much.  How about If I had a local broker and there are too many topics, is it make sense if I wanna remove it?"
42218056,71603797,42220926,3,0,Tue Feb 14 09:05:00 EST 2017,504554,"Retained messages are something different again, you publish a message with an empty payload to the topic to clear a retained message"
42218056,71604105,42220926,3,0,Tue Feb 14 09:14:00 EST 2017,7040863,"I see. Thank you for those informative stuffs. I'll try to understand more about it."

Saw your answer about removing the persistence file on a retained thread I'll try too because the above doesn't always work on my system. Thanks! You da man! :)"
42218056,101252594,53575071,3,0,Tue Aug 06 21:32:00 EDT 2019,504554,"That is how to remove retained messages, which is not what the question is about."

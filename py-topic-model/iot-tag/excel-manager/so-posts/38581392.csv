Get all available slots for a given location and time period	 2. Dynamic pricing for parking slots as per traffic like more traffic 	       more charges.	 3. Suggestion for available booking slots at near location , in case no    slots available at requested location.	 4. During post analytics  used data model able to give results like 	          a. Most used parking slots	          b. Peak traffic hours	          c. optimize unused traffic slots	 5. In every booking slot there is difference of 30 min. no idea how to optimize this.	 6. How to detect booking slot overlapping and then suggest available booking slot option.	</code></pre>		<p>I am planning to  design this system with Tree based data model but thing that blocking me is that in case number of concurrent user going to millions then we need to traverse lot's of tree node to get available time slots.  Any better approach to build such system.              </p>	"

I am sharing this document specially for the section that touches some of the possibilities for communication models - Device-To-Device, Device-To-Cloud, Device-To-Gateway and Back-End-Data-Sharing models. Perhaps these modelling analysis adds a bit to your analysis and design."

I am very confused about programming the gateway, do i need to tell it to connect to the node and to the server ? or does it recieve the date automatically ? and do I program the server to connect to the gateway or directly to the nodes ? </p>	"

Devices perform a join-procedure with the network, during which a	  dynamic DevAddr is assigned and security keys are negotiated with the	  device.</p>	  	  <p>Activation by Personalization (ABP) In some cases you might need to	  hardcode the DevAddr as well as the security keys in the device. This	  means activating a device by personalization (ABP). This strategy	  might seem simpler, because you skip the join procedure, but it has	  some downsides related to security.</p>	</blockquote>		<p><strong>2)</strong> do i need to tell it to connect to the server? and do I program the server to connect to the gateway or directly to the nodes ?</p>		<p>Your server shouldn't talk to the nodes, it only communicates with your LoRaWAN gateway.</p>		<p>There are several ways for a gateway to send data to your server. For example, you could use MQTT or Protocol Buffer.</p>	"

A LoRaWAN gateway is essential just a packet forwarder. The specific Network Server to communicate with is, in general, configured in each LoRaWAN gateway.  </p>		<p>As a starting point have a look at this implementation:	<a href="https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder</a></p>		<p>Note: Any LoRaWAN packet received from the gateway's RF module is forwarded to the Network Server and vice versa*. The Network Server handles: end-device authentication, end-device message de/encryption on the session level, end-device duplicated messages, end-device replayed messages, end-device data rate throttling, data/routing exchange with user applications (This is where commercial Networks Server solutions have loads of options), and more... </p>	"

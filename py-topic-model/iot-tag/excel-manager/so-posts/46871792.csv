Many thanks, 	Shid </p>	"

From what I know, to use a KAA server, you should utilize the SDK obtained when you create a new application on the KAA server. This SDK also functions as an API key that will connect the device with a KAA server (on a KAA server named with Application Token). The platforms provided for using this SDK are C, C ++, Java, Android, and Objective C. There is currently no SDK for the Python platform.</p>	"

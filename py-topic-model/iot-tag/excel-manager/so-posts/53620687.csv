I've successfully deployed it to the Raspberry about two weeks ago and	haven't developed on it since.</p>		<p>Now I wanted to deploy the app onto the Raspberry again, but it doesn't work	anymore. Everytime I get the error:</p>		<p><strong>Error DEP0100 : Please ensure that target device has developer mode enabled.	Could not obtain a developer license due to error 80004001.</strong></p>		<p>Things I have tried and checked:</p>		<ul>	<li>My Win10 machine is still in developer mode. I've tried switching it on and	off.</li>	<li>I restarted VS and the Pi multiple times</li>	<li>I tried to deploy it in Release and Debug mode </li>	<li>I cleaned and rebuilt the solution multiple times</li>	<li>I tried changing authentication to "none"</li>	<li>I tried changing the minimum/target version of the project</li>	<li>updated all NuGet packages</li>	<li>checked if I'm signed into VS</li>	</ul>		<p>Been wasting way too many hours on this and I'm really hoping for a solution!</p>	"

Because you won't be able to manage authentication or encryption on the PLC.</p>		<p>The protocol would be based on simple TCP socket (standard) then you must create the buffer on the PLC and decode it in your Azure instance, with your own protocol and data definitions.</p>		<p>Hope it helps ;-)</p>	"

54280812,95517108,54343495,3,0,Thu Jan 24 16:09:00 EST 2019,8166445,"I've heard this morning about Siemens IoT2040, it could be well adapted in this case. A sort of industrial Raspberry PI : use Modbus server or OPC server on S7-1200 then the gateway grabs the datas, format them and send them to your azure instance with all the needed security requirements. But it depends of the security level you need and how you manage it on azure."

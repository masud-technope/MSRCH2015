That is a field gateway(sort of like a smart router) sits between the server and edge devices and does the preprocessing and edge computing.</p>		<p>What I am wondering is whether field gateways provided from either vendor(AWS or Azure) can be nested as parent and children to create multi-layered IoT device hierarchies. That is gateways connected to gateways and so on.</p>		<p>EDIT - This kind of hierarchies would create Fog networks which would enable sub-networks within the hierarchy to function more independently without being over-reliant on the server. Also, they'd reduce the load on the server if the edge gateway could do edge computing while reducing latency as well.</p>	"

Would you mind sharing the reason that you want to insert a gate between edge device and Azure IoT hub?"

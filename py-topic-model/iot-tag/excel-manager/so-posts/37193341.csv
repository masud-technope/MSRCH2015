Right now i recieve the temperature as a JSON file in Azure Storage. </p>		<p>Is there any way to do HTTP request or something to the storage account?	This is the JSON file: <a href="https://pptlbhstorage.blob.core.windows.net/temperature/0_d1e8a2b709b14461b5ac12265f33020b_1.json" rel="nofollow">https://pptlbhstorage.blob.core.windows.net/temperature/0_d1e8a2b709b14461b5ac12265f33020b_1.json</a></p>		<p>Also, should i make a WepAPI that recieves theese data? so i also can make mobile app and not only webpage? </p>	"
37193341,61920412,37193341,3,0,Thu May 12 17:43:00 EDT 2016,4638462,"Is that possible?"

37193341,37193411,37193341,2,1,Thu May 12 17:12:00 EDT 2016,1963868,"<p>Yes, you may get the files out from the Azure Storage using the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/" rel="nofollow">official SDKs</a>. For that, you will need the Blob functionality - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs/" rel="nofollow">take a look here</a>. 	And, if you want your own implementation, you can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd135733.aspx" rel="nofollow">Azure Storage REST API</a>.</p>		<pre><code> CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("ahrimanstoraccount_AzureStorageConnectionString"));	        CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();	        CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("vhds");	        CloudBlockBlob blockBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("yourfilename.txt");		        string path = (@"C:\Temp\yourlocalfilename.txt");	        blockBlob.DownloadToFile(path, FileMode.OpenOrCreate);	</code></pre>		<p>app.config:</p>		<pre><code>&lt;appSettings&gt;	 &lt;add key="ahrimanstoraccount_AzureStorageConnectionString" value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=myAccountName;AccountKey=myAccountKey" /&gt;	&lt;/appSettings&gt;	</code></pre>		<p>UPD from the comments: the same approach is working for Console and ASP.NET MVC. Azure Storage may be added by 1) Click on the project => Add => Add Connected Service => Azure Storage => Select your storage account. That will install all of needed libraries and valid connection string into your web.config. 2) Once it is done, the browser will open the page where code pieces will be shown	and manually, by going to the Azure Storage page and copying keys/names to the connection string.</p>	"

37193341,61922060,37193411,3,0,Thu May 12 18:30:00 EDT 2016,1963868,"Ok. First, Click on your project, "Manage NuGet packages", go to "Browse" => enter "azure storage", once it find the packages WindowsAzure.Storage and Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ConfigurationManager, install both of the packages."
37193341,61922147,37193411,3,0,Thu May 12 18:32:00 EDT 2016,1963868,"After that, paste the code i provided to your Main class, and open app.config. Paste the appsettings block here as i changed in the answer."

37193341,61922393,37193411,3,0,Thu May 12 18:40:00 EDT 2016,1963868,"Exactly as you said."

37193341,61922582,37193411,3,0,Thu May 12 18:46:00 EDT 2016,1963868,"Yes, absolutely. Also you may want to try SignalR for real-time stuff as described [here](http://www.mikelanzetta.com/2015/08/real-time-mapping-with-signalr-and-event-hubs/). It uses Event Hubs, but i suspect you use that or the IoT Hub."
37193341,61922738,37193411,3,0,Thu May 12 18:50:00 EDT 2016,4638462,"No i am actually using Event Hubs as the Particle Photon already provides their own cloud service. I will look into SignalR! Thank you so much for your help!"

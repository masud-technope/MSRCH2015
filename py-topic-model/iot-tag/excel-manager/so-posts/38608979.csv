Calculation formula is </p>		<pre><code>Time(s) = Data(bits) / Rate(bps)	</code></pre>		<p>For example, if the rate is 20 kbps, the data(message) is 200 Bytes, so the time is </p>		<pre><code>(200*8)/(20*1000)=0.08s=80ms	</code></pre>		<p>If you use 250kbps the time is <code>6.4ms</code>.</p>		<p>Note: Time calculated here is the time of transmitting message in the air. Generally, actual time is longer because processing time does not take into account here.</p>	"

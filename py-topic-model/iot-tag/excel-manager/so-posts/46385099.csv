I was able to setup the Arduino IDE 1.8.4 (From Windows Store) on my PC which is a Windows 10. In the step 1.8 (Build Your Remote Monitoring Sample), when I try to compile the solution "remote_monitoring.ino" dowonload from <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-c-m0wifi-getstartedkit/archive/master.zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>, it appears the following error:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>C:\iot-hub-c-m0wifi-getstartedkit-master\remote_monitoring\remote_monitoring.ino:12:22:	  fatal error: sys/time.h: No such file or directory</p>	  	  <p><code>#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;</code></p>	  	  <p>compilation terminated.</p>	  	  <p>exit status 1 Error compiling for board Arduino/Genuino Uno.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>It seems like in Windows, including sys/time.h just doesn't Works, but if I try to delete the sys/ part, it comes the following error:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>C:\Users\jonguz\OneDrive -	  Microsoft\Documents\Arduino\libraries\AzureIoTHub\src/sdk/serializer.h:42:19:	  fatal error: cstdlib: No such file or directory</p>	  	  <p><code>#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;</code></p>	</blockquote>		<p>I appreciate your help.</p>	"

If you don't have one of those boards selected then the file will not be found, thus the error messages you encountered.</p>		<p>From <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-wifi-atwinc1500/using-with-arduino-ide" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-wifi-atwinc1500/using-with-arduino-ide</a>:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>Select the matching board, the current options are:</p>	  	  <ul>	  <li>Feather M0 (for use with any Feather M0 other than the Express)</li>	  </ul>	</blockquote>		<p>So the solution is to select Tools > Board > Adafruit Feather M0 after installing Adafruit SAMD Boards via Boards Manager but before compiling the sketch.</p>	"

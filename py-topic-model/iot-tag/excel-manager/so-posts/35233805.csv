All works fine but i want to log the traffic an also realise if something goes wrong.</p>		<p>So I programmed this LogFilewriter:</p>		<pre><code> public static void write(string message)	    {           		            using (StreamWriter w = File.AppendText("\\" + "log.txt"))	            {	                logging(message, w);	            }		    }	    public static void logging(string logMessage, TextWriter w)	    {	        w.Write("\r\nLog Entry : ");	        w.WriteLine("{0} {1}", DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay, DateTime.Now.Date);	        w.WriteLine("  :");	        w.WriteLine("  :{0}", logMessage);	        w.WriteLine("-------------------------------");	    }	</code></pre>		<p>The Problem is that if i call Log.write(message)   - (Log is the class) it throws following Exception:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>Blockquote	  Exception thrown: 'System.UnauthorizedAccessException' in System.IO.FileSystem.dll</p>	</blockquote>		<p>Has somebody an idea why this exception is thrown?</p>	"

We used them and had no issues so far. When I tried to work with the File class in the first release, it wasn't available at all.</em></p>		<p><em>Maybe this changed now. Try saving the file in your file in the "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\YOURPACKAGE". The application should have access there and maybe you can use the File class then.</em></p>		<p>Read the whole thing because it also mentions that the file IO is sandboxed, and provides this link to suggest how to write to a file,</p>		<p><a href="http://grogansoft.com/blog/?p=554" rel="nofollow">http://grogansoft.com/blog/?p=554</a></p>	"

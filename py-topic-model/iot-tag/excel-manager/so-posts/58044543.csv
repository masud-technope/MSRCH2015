I run a hosted Node-Red instance to listen to data from an external MQTT Broker, transform the incoming messages somewhat based on topic and then post them to IoT Central through/using the IoT Central Bridge. </p>		<p>The address to POST to is created when deploying the IoT Central Bridge, but its is plain open and directly reachable from for example Postman. </p>		<p>Since I am trying to ingest data from 200+ devices sending data over/through an MQTT Broker DPS is not an option. I will not be able to map and add new dspkeygen-generated tokens for all devices. The MQTT Broker is actually the natural inbound "client device" in this case. </p>		<p>But, I do need to secure access to the IoT Central Bridge POST address, is that possible to accomplish somehow? </p>	"

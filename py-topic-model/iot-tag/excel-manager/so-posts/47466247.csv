I see there are two famous devices for IOT are, Espruino and Raspberry Pi.</p>		<p>I installed Espruino as web  IDE, but during publish it is asking me plug in.	Some videos recommends me to buy Raspberry Pi device also.</p>		<p>Question is, Do I have to buy device, or we have some tool available, which I can use for learning purpose?</p>		<p>Thanks.</p>	"

All the internet functionality will work, however obviously you won't be able to access anything in the real world.</p>		<p>You can buy official Espruino boards pretty cheaply ($25), or you can run the Espruino software on an ESP8266 (which costs around $5 for a USB connected board) - it'll just be a little less plug and play, and isn't officially supported by the creators.</p>		<p>Raspberry Pis are also very cheap ($10 for the Zero W with internet connectivity), but you'll have to factor in the cost of an SD card too.</p>		<p>If you really don't want a physical device, you can actually rent Raspberry Pis (eg. <a href="https://raspberry-hosting.com/en" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://raspberry-hosting.com/en</a>) or as Sudheesh mentioned in response to your post there are emulators as well.</p>		<p>However given the time you're likely to spend learning to use IoT devices, spending a few dollars buying hardware to use would be a very good investment.</p>	"

We have a gps tracker ST-901 in which the ip and port can be specified for sending gps data.	A python socket server script was created in local machine(connected to wifi router) and the server was meant for listening to the incoming connections from the gps tracker. But the script is not receiving any data.</p>		<p>Say, the router's public ip is 10.175.31.48	The local machine is connected to this router. With the port number 5013, the connections should be sent to this local machine using port forwarding.</p>		<p>Also we set the ip and port address of the tracker as same as the router.</p>		<pre><code> import socket;			import sys;	import h2o;			s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);	print "Socket created successfully";	port=5013;	s.bind(('',port));	print "socket binded to port %s" %(port);	s.listen(5);	print "socket is listening";	print socket.gethostname();	try:	        c,addr=s.accept();	        print "got connection from",addr;	        c.send('thank you connected');	        c.send("how are you")	        data=c.recv(1024);	        print data;	finally:	    c.close();	</code></pre>		<p>I am unable to receive gps data.

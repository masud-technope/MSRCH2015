Is there any way of doing it? or is it even possible? Also, if my IoT device receives a push notification, is there any way I can perform some actions as soon as a notification arrives assuming the IoT UWP application is running and the user has can't tap on the notification. Can I handle such an event? </p>	"

You can read more about it on MSDN: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/mt187203.aspx" rel="nofollow">Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) overview</a>.</p>		<p>Your client code can handle incoming "raw" push notifications. The raw notifications don't show any UI by default, but you can have your background task show the UI if you also want to notify the user.

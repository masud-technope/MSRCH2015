They dont have public API exposed and i dont know how they are sending the data.</p>		<p>Is there anyone who have already done this kind of IoT example which involves reading data through bluetooth connection through logging or other methods.	If anyone have experience, could you please explain me the exact devices you used for this project and how you retreived the data.	If you haven't done this kind of work,still you can suggest the approach to build this kind of project.</p>		<p>Thanks,	Parveen</p>	"

32210899,52314926,32210899,3,0,Tue Aug 25 23:18:00 EDT 2015,3003365,"You have to reverse engineer the protocol and commands that the oximeter accepts. There is no single answer that will cover all devices. But if  you have a particular device then google it and you may find that someone has already reverse engineered it. Alternatively you can approach the vendor and request a copy of their API documentation. They may or may not make that available to third party developers depending on their policy."

You would then just need to add a bluetooth module to the example, there are many tutorials online how to add bluetooth to Arduino.</p>	"

32210899,52306835,32210960,3,0,Tue Aug 25 18:33:00 EDT 2015,5264870,"Bluetooth is a standard, so if you already have a bluetooth enabled pulse ox it should come with software to read it at least on PC. If there is no software then you would need to write a program to read directly from bluetooth. It would be tough to 'hack' an Android app to get the data out. Raspberry PI is just a linux PC so you would still need to write a program to access the BT data.

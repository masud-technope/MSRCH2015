Is it possible to tell IoTHub to delay the delivery of specific messages?</p>		<p>From looking at the Microsoft documentation I can see it allows you to throttle messages, however I am after being able to do this only for specific messages so unless my understanding of how the throttling works, it would not suit my purpose.</p>		<p>Is this built into IoTHub or would I need to control the timing of messages from within my own application?</p>	"

Have a look at more details <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-jobs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>		<p>For your scenario, you can create a job to execute direct methods on the specific devices and time. Note, that this is a sync invoked method on the connected device.</p>		<p>In the case, where your devices can be disconnected, you have to use an async communication known as Cloud-To-Device (C2D) Messaging at the service-facing endpoint. There is no capability to schedule a C2D message within the Azure IoT Hub. It must be done outside of the Azure IoT Hub using for instance a Service Bus Queue and Azure Function.</p>	"

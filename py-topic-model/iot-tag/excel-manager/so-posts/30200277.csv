I am following a very handy guide published <a href="http://ms-iot.github.io/content/win10/samples/HelloWorld.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>		<p>Everything's fine but I get a peculiar warning when trying to run the <code>iotstartup</code> command after having established the <code>PsSession</code>.</p>		<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j6QHv.png" alt="ps snippet"></p>		<p>If I simply press return again, the message disappears and the command seems to work fine...</p>		<p>Am I doing something wrong here?  Is it a known powershell thing, or has something gone awry on my device?   (If it's of any significance, I had to re-flash the OS once or twice in order to get anything to deploy remotely).</p>		<p>I hope it's not my device; but I would be interested to hear of any clarification on this sort of issue.</p>	"

To see the Android OS load and work on it I tried connecting a HDMI cable from board to Laptop(Windows 7/8, Dell inspiron) but even after several minutes I do not see any detection of the board on my laptop.</p>		<p>1.Connected HDMI to DragonBoard and Laptop.	2.Connected power adapter to board.	3. User-1 LED light glows intermittently on the board.	Board not detected even after several minutes, so i tried to goto control panel and add device but no luck there also.</p>		<p>Not sure if the HDMI cable has the problem or the board. Please help on troubleshooting and solving this.</p>	"

And you're trying to use it as a video input.</p>		<p>You need to use a device that has an HDMI input slot, such as a TV or PC Monitor.</p>		<p>You can also try to use a HDMI->VGA converter, to get a wide range of compatible Computer Monitors, but beware that I only manage it to work in the forth brand of converter. (The other aren't broken, just didn't work with the DB410C).</p>		<p>For futhermore, I recommend to use SSH.</p>	"

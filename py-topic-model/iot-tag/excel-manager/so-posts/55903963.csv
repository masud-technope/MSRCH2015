I just realized that MS Azure has launched a newer version for Protocol Gateway called <strong>IoT Edge</strong>. I was just looking for the new feature available in IoT Edge and now I'm completely confused between both components:</p>		<ul>	<li>IoT Edge majorly supports local connectivity between device and	gateway. What if this is not part of my requirement? Should I still upgrade to IoT Edge? </li>	<li>I don't see any performance improvements -	Protocol Gateway vs Iot Edge</li>	</ul>		<p>I understand that the answer could be a broader discussion but can anyone provide a simple explanation? </p>	"

It allows data processing and analysis nearest the IoT devices. This shortens the latency regarding some requests which have "critical time" requirements, since the data do not need to reach the cloud.</p>		<p>The IoT Hub is a <em>protocol gateway</em>. I think the main requirement here is not "performance". So, the point is not to compare between IoT Edge and IoT Hub. The key point about IoT Hub is the interoperability it provides between some common protocols used by IoT devices: AMQP, MQTT and HTTPS. It is more related to the ease of integration among IoT system components that may be using different protocols to communicate.</p>	"

For example devices that do not hold their own IoT Hub identity but speak in different protocols, to make the conversation in a common meaning, the identity translation is required. The Azure Protocol gateway does this extensively. Once the uncommon protocols (i.e., Bacnet, OPC-UA, BLE, Proprietary) are used from several devices in the field, the Azure Protocol Gateway translates to IoT Hub Primities and send the data using MQTT, AMQP to the IoT Hub premises. This gives data transparency as well.</p>		<p>So in simple words azure protocol gateway helps in protocol translation while azure iot edge provides transparency and IoT Hub identity to the field devices.</p>	"

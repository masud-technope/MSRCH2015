However, it may be more expedient if you open a support ticket so we can get specific details about your IoT configuration."

Since I cannot at the image to this answer I will add it to the org question (please look above). The problem stays the same, only data gathered from the moment the card was open is shown; the historical data in the database is NOT taken into account. So the 24hrs - 10 seconds interval that you can select during card configuration has no effect, and I gelieve this is just the same setting that you can configured on the visualized card itself by using the dropdown."

But I couldn't find any content in this matter. I will be so thankful, if anyone would help me, in dealing with the same.</p>		<p>PS: I have already followed the interactive tutorial from Google Cloud itself and connected a simulated virtual device to Cloud and sent data. I am really looking for a tutorial, that helps me in connecting physical Raspberry Pi. </p>		<p>Thank you</p>	"

You can create Data Fusion instance in order to create Streaming ETL pipeline. The source will be pubsub and sink will be Big Query or Big Table based on your use case.</p>	"

But the later part of Dataflow, ETL, talend, Apache, Data fusion etc, i don't know any of these. I am a complete beginner for all of these. Any tutorual link, like that will help me in form of video series / documentation. Thanks in advance"

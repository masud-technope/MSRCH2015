I need the actual time everytime I collect a measure with a sensor in order to send a pair: temperature-date for making a datalogger and I am thinking that may be better to substitute the http request for the RTC."

So, yes, skipping the NTP sync if not absolutely necessary will help. Or you could do that only 1x in 24h or so. And remember...when you send an HTTP request to a server its response usually contains a `Date` header with the server time. You could just parse that one and skip the extra NTP request. Thingspeak currently returns `Date: Mon, 09 Jul 2018 19:56:16 GMT`.		You may want to have a look at https://thingpulse.com/5-hacks-prolong-espapers-battery-run-time."

During my tests the RTC module has never failed, on the contrary, the wifi/internet/ntp connection sometimes has failed.</p>		<p>The RTC module can be programmed offline and then mounted in the circuit. It has a back-up battery that should guarantee a duration of a couple of years (like a wristwatch). In my case (as also recommended by Marcel St√∂r) I will use date and time coming from the RTC module and only once a week I will try the calibration using the NTP protocol.</p>		<p>At last but not least, keep in mind that many iot cloud platforms accept only the data and as a timestamp use that of receiving stream itself and not one provided by the device.</p>		<p><strong>Then, for battery saving (and reliability), is better to use RTC.</strong></p>	"

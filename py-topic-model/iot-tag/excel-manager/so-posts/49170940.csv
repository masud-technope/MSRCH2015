To do this, i tried to do port forwarding to the local ip of the camera. then, i tried accessing it through router WAN address, followed by port number. If i try to access with the same wireless network, it is completely fine (it should right? because it is not going behind the gateway and coming in again.). If i try to access it through different network. It gives me timeout error. I also tried it with ports instead of 80.</p>		<p>IP camera network setting</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0iMNa.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0iMNa.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>Router port forwarding pages:</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3vog8.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3vog8.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LHzyu.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LHzyu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>	"

To troubleshoot this I would try the following:</p>		<ol>	<li><p>Reset the router.</p></li>	<li><p>In the port forwarding configuration setup of the router, instead of using a range, try to use the port number. For example, instead of 80-80, use only 80. I not familiar with that firmware, but if it is possible try this.</p></li>	<li><p>Change the ports. Leave the external one 80, and change the internal one to 8080 (or something similar). Check if you can access the camera's web client internally using the new port. You will need to change the port number in the camera's streaming server.</p></li>	<li><p>Install another firmware on the router (e.g., DD-WRT)</p></li>	</ol>	"

It is accessible locally but not able to access with different network. option 4 is not supported in my router. and also, i am currently using ACT fibernet. Is there any possibility that there is some wrong with them?"

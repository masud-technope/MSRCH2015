I used the 8280 port with both the ip address and the full hostname of my server, same error in both cases.	Maybe i'll try setting up the whole thing from scratch"

46700936,80463102,46710179,3,0,Sun Oct 15 19:03:00 EDT 2017,8465139,"That is correct if you have run the change-ip.sh script."

I tried with my Note 4 and it register. Also register correctly with a LG G Flex. I'll try more devices.	Do you have any idea why i do get the message above when i run the broker server?"
46700936,80482325,46710179,3,0,Mon Oct 16 10:51:00 EDT 2017,6849788,"Found out the reason : i had an old version of the android agent also installed,( from EMM 2.2.0 if i remember correctly). I uninstalled that one, restarted the device and could register it.	Besides that specific phone location feature not working, everything works quite good now. Another question: when i ring a device or send a message, it can take up to 5 minutes for the device to receive that message, is that a normal behavior? 	I also have another issue : i can't access the management console at hostname:9763/carbon or hostname:9443/carbon.	I have a blank white page."

I hope you have started all 3 servers (broker, analytics, and iot-core) or at least 2 of them. If yes, can you restart only the iot-core server and it will fix the "carbon" console issue for iot-core. To make sure that you can log in to carbon console of the iot-core server, start that server at last after other two servers (broker and analytics) started."

Code : 500	Error: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Handshakefailed.`		Seems pretty clear now that it is linked to the SSL certificate. But	1- I tried to follow the link, stuck on the 2nd part as i can't find a way to update the SDK from command line. I don't have a desktop environment installed on my server so no GUI for me.	3- I use a default Debian image, so no ports restriction.		I actually used the change-ip.sh script to get to this point"

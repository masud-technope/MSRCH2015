A solution is to buy a little module which can read analog and then write it in a serial communication to read it with RPi.</p>		<p>If you don't want to buy that kind of module there is a tricks which use a capacitor and then computes the time between two ones to know the value between 0 and 1024 for example. This article explains that well : <a href="https://fr.scribd.com/document/193892647/RaspberryPi-Analogue-Input-with-Capacitor-node-js" rel="nofollow noreferrer">capacitor analog</a></p>	"

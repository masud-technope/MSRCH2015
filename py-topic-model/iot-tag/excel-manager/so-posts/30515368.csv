I am using an alpha version of a Redpine signals board (they gave use exclusive access for a class at my university).</p>		<p>My problem is <em>I don't really know much about html requests</em>. </p>		<p>Is it possible to do something simple like post a twitter status using only POST and/or GET?</p>	"

Twitter is one of these services; check out their REST api documentation: <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public" rel="nofollow">https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public</a></p>		<p>Here's the endpoint to POST an update: <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/statuses/update" rel="nofollow">https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/statuses/update</a></p>		<p>I'd guess the trickiest thing for you will be figuring out the auth... start here: <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/introduction" rel="nofollow">https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/introduction</a></p>	"

Unfortunately it's kind of complicated. I think https://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/07/29/1/oauth2-simplified explains it fairly coherently."

You can find a token for your account at https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/ and then use it in a request like `GET https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/me?access_token=YOUR_LONG_FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE` -- remember that token is more or less a password to your account, so guard it carefully."

Do I need to use two "topics"?:</p>		<ul>	<li>One topic for the device to publish information to be subscribed by the Node-Red application.</li>	<li>One topic for the Node-RED application to publish (and the device to subscribe to).</li>	</ul>		<p>Alternatively, can both the device and Node-RED application post different information (both publishing and subscribing) to the same topic? </p>		<p>For example: If the device is both publishing temperature data and also subscribing to the same topic to get information from Node-RED in Bluemix, will that cause issues?  There are two types of data I want to exchange:</p>		<ul>	<li>The Device would be publishing temperatures.</li>	<li>The Node-RED application would be publishing "user request" information that would tell the device when to report temperatures.</li>	</ul>	"

So the device should publish that event to a topic in the format iot-2/evt/event_id/fmt/format_string and your Node-RED application will be publishing a command to a different topic. </p>		<p>For example... 	You could publish temperatures like this: </p>		<p>iot-2/evt/temperature/fmt/json <code>{ d: { temp: 25 } }</code> 	and publish commands to the device like this: iot-2/cmd/sendTemperature/fmt/json </p>		<p>The device would subscribe to the command topic, and the application (Node-RED) to the event topic.  Specifically, when you are publishing events, you publish to topic iot-2/evt/event_id/fmt/format_string and devices subscribe to commands by subscribing to topic iot-2/cmd/command_id/fmt/format_string</p>		<p>See the online <a href="http://%20http://iotf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/messaging/devices.html#publishing-events" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for MQTT and IoT.  </p>	"

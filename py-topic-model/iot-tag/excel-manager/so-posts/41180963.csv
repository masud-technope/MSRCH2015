Here was the issue: I was not able to ping anything running on LAN.</p>		<p>Following is the solution in my case. </p>		<p>I am using D-Link router and there is NO rule of IP filtering. </p>		<p>The fix is to disable "Enable MultiAP Isolation" option. </p>		<p>Go to router setup page (192.168.1.1) --> Setup --> Wireless --> Wireless Basic and un-check the box "Enable MultiAP Isolation" and press "Apply" button. </p>		<p>This fixed the problem immediately and I could ping all devices on the LAN.</p>	"

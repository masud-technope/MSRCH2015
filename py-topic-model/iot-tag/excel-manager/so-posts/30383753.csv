I'm running Mosquitto v1.4.2 and I've added the following lines to the mosquitto configuration file (mosquitto.conf):</p>		<pre><code>listener 10001 127.0.0.1	protocol websockets		listener 1883	protocol mqtt	</code></pre>		<p>When I try and start the broker with the new configuration I get the following :</p>		<pre><code>$ mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf	Error: Websockets support not available.	Error found at /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf:16.	Error: Unable to open configuration file.	</code></pre>		<p>I was under the assumption that version 1.4 and above of Mosquitto has websocket support now (don't have to build from source to enable websocket support like you had to before v1.4) so I'm wondering what I'm missing. Any help on what direction to look to troubleshoot the problem is appreciated.</p>		<p>Edit: Forgot to mention I'm running CentOS6</p>	"

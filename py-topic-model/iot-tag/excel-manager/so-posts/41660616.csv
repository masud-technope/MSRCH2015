We have a organery with many sensors, those sensors are connected to arduino's. We have some arduino's who are connected to a raspberry by serial communication using an I2C connection. <strong>Then we want to send that data to the firebase cloud</strong>. But honestly i have no clue how i have to do that. That data from the cloud we use to make an app to see the "climate" of our arganery.</p>		<p>Our program in arduino is made in C++, and the raspberry code is also in C++. Any ideas to get that data into the firebase cloud? Thank You for reading!</p>		<p>Greeting Iben</p>	"

Node-RED is a very powerful and easy to use tool for IoT.</p>		<p>You can run bot Mosquitto and Node-RED on your Raspberry Pi.</p>	"

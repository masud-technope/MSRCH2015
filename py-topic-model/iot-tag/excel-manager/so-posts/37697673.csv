However this is not the correct approach, therefore we will be restricting to use only one token per device from the Beta release onwards</p>	"

If you have 100 different device **types** then you have to manage 100 different device connectors. (Each of this device connector should consists of the relevant API,  UI extensions, agents, etc.). So if you have 100 device types, You have to write 100 different manuals through UI extensions. But if you have 100 devices for a **particular device type**, then you can register those devices using the device agent for that device type. (And only one device manual can be maintained to provide details of the device type)"

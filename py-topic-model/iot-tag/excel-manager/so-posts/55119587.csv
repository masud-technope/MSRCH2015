I am not sure if I have correctly defined my topic which I am calling my/Volume because of the thing name. Here is its ARN:</p>		<p>arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:468820349153:thing/Volume</p>		<p>A basic test insert using the IoT test MQTT client was able to insert data into the table.  I created a rule called VolumeRule with this query: SELECT * FROM 'my/Volume'.</p>		<p>Thanks for your help,</p>		<p>Steve</p>	"

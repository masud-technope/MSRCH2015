The iothub_ll_telemetry_sample sends message up to cloud from Pi3 successfully, but the iothub_ll_c2d_sample shows random receiving or no receiving of "hello world" messages.</p>		<p>The Azure Function in C# or Javascript follows the tutorial examples, which I assume no problem.</p>		<p>I am just wondering if I missing something here, or not doing it correctly.</p>	"

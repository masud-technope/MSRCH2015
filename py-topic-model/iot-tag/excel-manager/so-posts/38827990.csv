I came to know that arduino cant work on that temperature range.</p>		<p>I need to deploy something into a freezer like thing which can sense the -°C temperature and send it to the cloud or send it to some controller(wire less) near by and that controller will send the data to raspberry-pi or cloud.</p>		<p>Thank you for the valuable commands.</p>	"

Yes I just want to place the sensor inside the unit, and the rest outside. But how can I send that sensed data to the controlling unit using wireless method. I don't find any solution for this."

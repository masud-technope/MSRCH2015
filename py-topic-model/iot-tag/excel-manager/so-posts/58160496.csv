I used the quick connect method to register my board and create the Iot Thing. I also Erased the flash memory before debugging the project thinking that might be causing the issue. </p>		<p>I am using <strong>System workbench on windows 10 (64 bit)</strong> for the project and Teraterm serial terminal with speed setting 115200</p>		<p>Could anyone please let me know how to resolve this issue?

After unzipping it, you should place the aws_clientcredential.h and aws_clientcredential_keys.h files in the demos/include directory of the Amazon FreeRTOS project (replace the same files already in that directory).</p>	"

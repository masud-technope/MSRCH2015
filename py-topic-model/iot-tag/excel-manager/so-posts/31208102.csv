Being new to Linux( I am more on windows guy) , I am stuck with following question.</p>		<ol>	<li><p>I started HiveMQ with command as ./bin/run.sh . A window opens and confirm that HiveMQ is running..Great !!!. I started this with putty and when I close the putty , HiveMQ also stops. How to make HiveMQ run all the time ?.</p></li>	<li><p>I am using the HiveMQ for my IoT projects ( raspberry pi). I know to subscribe and publish to HiveMQ broker from python , but what confuses me is , should I be running the python program continuously to make this work ?. Assuming I need to trigger 2+ GPIO on Pi , can I write one program and keep it running  by making it subscribe to 2+ topic for trigger events ?.</p></li>	</ol>		<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

The details are covered in the documentation <a href="http://www.hivemq.com/docs/hivemq/2.3.1/#hivemqdocs_installation_for_specific_operating_systems" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you have a debian based system, execute the following commands:</p>		<pre><code>cp /opt/hivemq/bin/init-script/hivemq-debian /etc/init.d/hivemq	chmod +x /etc/init.d/hivemq	</code></pre>		<p>For other Linux Systems the following should do it:</p>		<pre><code>cp /opt/hivemq/bin/init-script/hivemq /etc/init.d/hivemq	chmod +x /etc/init.d/hivemq	</code></pre>		<p>Now you can start HiveMQ in the background with <code>/etc/init.d/hivemq start</code>. </p>	"

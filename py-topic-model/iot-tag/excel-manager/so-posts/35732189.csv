In pre-1.0 SDKs <code>conn:send</code> was synchronous i.e. you could call it sequentially and it would block until each string was sent. Espressif later changed the underlying function to be <em>asynchronous</em>. Hence, the code at <a href="https://github.com/ok1cdj/ESP8266-LUA/blob/master/Thermometer-DS18B20-Thingspeak/ds1820.lua#L77" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ok1cdj/ESP8266-LUA/blob/master/Thermometer-DS18B20-Thingspeak/ds1820.lua#L77</a> fails. See the the <a href="http://nodemcu.readthedocs.org/en/dev/en/modules/net/#netsocketsend" rel="nofollow"><code>net.socket:send()</code></a> API documentation for more details.</p>		<p>However, since you're already on a recent firmware version (from the <code>dev</code> branch I believe) you should make full use of the new HTTP module. <a href="http://nodemcu.readthedocs.org/en/dev/en/modules/http/#httpput" rel="nofollow"><code>http.put()</code></a> is way more convenient than to operate on the raw socket.</p>		<p>See <a href="https://mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/update-a-channel.html" rel="nofollow">https://mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/update-a-channel.html</a> for how to PUT data to ThingSpeak.</p>		<p>Side note: I suggest you also use DS18B20 sample code from <a href="https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/tree/dev/lua_modules/ds18b20" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/tree/dev/lua_modules/ds18b20</a> provided by the NodeMCU team. That code is much more likely to be in sync with the firmware.</p>	"

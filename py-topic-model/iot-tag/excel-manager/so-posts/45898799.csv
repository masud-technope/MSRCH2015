The thing is, here my work as so far:</p>		<ol>	<li>A controller (Arduino or Pi etc..) connected with devices like sensors</li>	<li>I receive the output from sensors and I store it in MySQL (local).</li>	</ol>		<p>How to send my sensor data to the web with the help of internet (ex. How to  monitor or send temp value in a website or anything)?</p>		<ul>	<li>How can I send sensor values to my web page where I can monitor?</li>	<li>To monitor my values do I need to buy or own a website?</li>	</ul>	"

Don't worry about cost, there are some websites which provide you free hosting (You can go for payed one as well if you need).</p>		<p>Eg : <a href="https://in.000webhost.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">000webhost</a></p>		<p>Prepare database as your need.So now you got your sever and database ready, arduino ready.</p>		<p>Now how you can store data to database from arduino , luckily I already answered about it on stack - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44243516/7699452">HERE</a>.</p>		<p>WOW we completed phase one!!</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>How can you view what you stored</p>	</blockquote>		<p>Its got plenty of options :</p>		<ul>	<li><p>Visit database : You can just go to the database and find what you got in it, But I wont suggest that because - It not so user interactive (but if no other option works you can go for it - usually never happens)</p></li>	<li><p>website : I would suggest this option. It is not laborious task to create a web page and connect it to server. As you already own a server, you can use same server for hosting website.</p></li>	<li><p>Mobile App : Another option is to create a mobile app and connect it to database, so that you can view the contents on your mobile. It is not easy unless you are good in android.</p></li>	</ul>		<p>So we are done. Think this helps you.</p>	"

Here i want to know that , i knw about the ooowebhost which you have mentioned , but the problem where im getting was , im not able to send my sensor data from my controller to the web host automatically (i have tried few tutorials but didn't get it ,all i have tried was filezilla(becoz i prefer python program only, rest of languages were complex interms of IoT(for me)))	Can you please suggest anything regarding sending sensor values (it would be great )"

45898799,78807937,45901508,3,0,Mon Aug 28 17:49:00 EDT 2017,7699452,"as it is a raspberry pi it is easy. Just dont look the arduino part in the link i provided in the above answer and you can create a php document with the database insertion action specified in that document and this url is to be requested from the pi. And pass the sensor data on this link to the PHP document. You can use any webhosting"

45898799,78808434,45901508,3,0,Mon Aug 28 18:05:00 EDT 2017,7699452,"yes you have to use either filezilla or should use another webhosts."

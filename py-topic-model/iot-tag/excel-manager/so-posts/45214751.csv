To get the internet state I am using this method:</p>		<pre><code>public static bool GetInternetConnectionState()	{	    var connection = NetworkInformation.GetInternetConnectionProfile();	    var internet = connection?.GetNetworkConnectivityLevel();	    return internet == NetworkConnectivityLevel.InternetAccess;	}	</code></pre>		<p>When I unplug the internet cable from router, my handler recognize the network has changed but this method still returns internet access true although internet is not available but when I remove the cable from RPi it works great. Does anybody know why is this happening?</p>	"

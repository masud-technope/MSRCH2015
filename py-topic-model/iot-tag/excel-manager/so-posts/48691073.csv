Arduino sends some values to azure where function application processes them and sends instructions for arduino to the endpoint in IoT hub. <em>(/devices/MKR1000/messages/devicebound?api-version=2016-02-03)</em>	I need to get data from this endpoint in real time so I want arduino to read only the last (the newest) message every time, but it starts from the oldest.</p>		<p>It's possible to make the arduino read all the messages from the endpoint and than show the last, but I'm looking for a more efficient way.</p>		<p>Thank you.</p>	"

It's a declarative pattern, so you would use it to express the desired state of your device (as opposed to invoke a command or send a message). Device twin changes can be listened to using a pub sub model, registering a callback, and on change you would read the device twin to see the new "desired" state."

I'll explain what is wrong with the code and how to fix it. </p>		<p>The example node.js application was written when the Geospatial Analytics service in Bluemix was in beta. The application uses http requests to call the service's REST APIs. When the service switched from beta to production it required using https for REST API access. The service no longer supports REST API access using http. That is what is causing the ECONNRESET in your application log.</p>		<p>To get the existing code working, in the app.js source file change line 462 from:</p>		<pre><code>http = require('http'),	</code></pre>		<p>to: </p>		<pre><code>https = require('https'),	</code></pre>		<p>And change line 617 from: </p>		<pre><code>var reqPut = http.request(options, function(res) {	</code></pre>		<p>to: </p>		<pre><code>var reqPut = https.request(options, function(res) {	</code></pre>		<p>After making the changes use <code>cf push</code> to update your application in Bluemix. When the application restarts you should see successful calls to the Geospatial Analytics REST APIs.</p>		<p>Having said all that, you can also use the final version of the connected car demo article at <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/mo-connectedcar-app/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/mo-connectedcar-app/index.html</a>. This updated article has a link to the current application code at jazz.net with the fix above in addition to some other enhancements and fixes.</p>	"

I will then apply Machine Learning on the collected data. I'm using Event Hubs and Stream Analytics. Is there a way of pulling the data to Azure Machine Learning without the hassle of writing an application to get it from Stream Analytics and push to AML web service?</p>	"

You can call custom AzureML function from your ASA query when you create this function from the portal.</p>		<p>See the following <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/nl-nl/documentation/articles/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> on how to achieve something like this.</p>	"

You can call any web service youâ€™ve published using AML from within Stream Analytics and apply it within your Stream Analytics query. Check this <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">link for a tutorial</a>.	Example workflow in your case would be like the following;</p>		<ul>	<li>Telemetry arrives and reaches Stream Analytics</li>	<li>Streaming Analytics (SA) calls the Machine Learning function to apply it on the data</li>	<li>SA redirects it to the output accordingly, here you can use the PowerBI to create a predictions dashboards.</li>	</ul>		<p>Another way would be using R, and hereâ€™s a good tutorial showing that <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2015/12/10/azure-ml-now-available-as-a-function-in-azure-stream-analytics/" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2015/12/10/azure-ml-now-available-as-a-function-in-azure-stream-analytics/</a> . 	It is more work of course but can give you more control as you control the code.</p>	"

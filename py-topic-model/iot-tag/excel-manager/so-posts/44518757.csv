44518757,44518757,null,1,1,Tue Jun 13 10:21:00 EDT 2017,6281808,"<p>I am trying to develop an Arduino sketch in order to send Temp-humi data from a dht11 sensor to KPN (Dutch) Network throughout a LoRa module (Dragino).	There are plenty of sketches around internet with similar function, but none of them has the right function I expect, since most of them ONLY send a simple 'Hello world' data throughout the ABP or OTAA Keys that the Network provides. In the other hand, I have also found sketches that ONLY makes the temp/humi functionality, withouth having the chance to write the Activation Keys. </p>		<p>So, I am actually trying to join these two codes with these functionalities (Request the Activation Keys to connect with KPN Network, as well as the sender sensor data), and it seems to compile properly, however, it is not sending any data, so probably the code is wrong.</p>		<p>May I get any link to the right one or any recommendation, please?</p>		<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>		<p>Project Code:</p>		<p><a href="https://github.com/Tonibco/Dragino-KPN-Project/blob/master/Dragino_KPN.ino" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enter link description here</a></p>	"

It is working properly, at least it is what appears on the console;		Packet queued 37102743: EV_TXCOMPLETE (includes waiting for RX windows) 2400.00		I guess 2400.00 is the Temperature value, is not it?		What about the humidity? Should I write the line...	`float a=(dht.readHumidity()*100);`	above the temperature one?"
44518757,77168066,45052619,3,0,Fri Jul 14 08:23:00 EDT 2017,7753291,"yes 2400 is your temperature. the siple reason i multiplied it by 100 is because you cant send float values. it has to be a number without decimal places. If you want to send the humidity you can change `float a=(dht.readTemperature()*100);` to `float a=(dht.readHumidity()*100); `"
44518757,77232398,45052619,3,0,Sun Jul 16 17:42:00 EDT 2017,6281808,"The purpose would be to add both values into the code.	So, I think I should change also the variables below the sensor readings, is that right? I am not sure how to code it.		`float a= dht.readHumidity();	float b= dht.readTemperature();		int c=(int)a, (int)c;	  data = c;`		Which API link should I provide to KPN support, in order to send my sensor data to ThinkSpeak platform. As they have already my public channel link, however, there are not changes as of yet.		Many thanks Felix!"

In the other hand, it seems that it's working with TTN samples anyway. I tested succesfully the sample from TTN which is sendind a 'Hello world' and, I have also been testing your sample with good results 	So, I was actually adding into your sample the chance to send data to ThingSpeak as well, however it doesn't work.

I would suggest you setup a [TTN account](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/users/login) and try if my original script works with your credentials. I think you have problems with connecting to a Gateway. Do you have an examplescript from KPN/Thingsspeak?  PS: I would not recommend you to post your CannelNumber and ApiKey on the Internet ;D"

What do you think?"

So, what I think is that I didn't modify correctly the script in order to send that data forward ThingSpeak throughout KPN.	KPN is a network provider spread around the whole country (Netherlands), rather than TTN which has limited coverage. In fact, I am able to see data within Hookbin endpoint instead, but my priority must be ThingSpeak, since I can monitorise the data graphically. 	Thanks!"

I found an example to connect the obd to local gateway (phone) via bluetooth or wifi but I want the tracker to be completely independant from any local gateway.	Is there a tutorial or documentation to help me getting starting with connecting 3g teacker to azure iot</p>	"

You can always use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-sdks" rel="nofollow noreferrer">device SDK</a> to connect to IoT Hub directly if your device is IP capable.</p>	"

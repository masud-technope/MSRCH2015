You should only have to register for an API Key once, and then use that key in all instances of your application."

Like you, I needed to generate API keys, that I could then use to register a device (without having to use the UI).</p>		<p>I solved it by using the following shell script to generate an API key.</p>		<pre><code># Create key to access service credentials	echo ""	echo "Now creating service keys for the IoT platform service ..."	cf create-service-key my-iotf-service mykey		# Accessing and storing credentials	cred=$(cf service-key my-iotf-service mykey)	</code></pre>		<p>Hope that helps</p>	"

Subscribe to the (free version) of the UAA service, and Time Series database service.  Create a UAA Client with permissions to access your Time Series instance.  Then you can use a websocket to securely push data into the cloud.  You can learn more by using the Predix Toolkit:  <a href="https://predix-toolkit.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://predix-toolkit.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io/</a>	(Source code for the toolkit is here: <a href="https://github.com/predixdev/security-starter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/predixdev/security-starter</a>)</p>		<p>Lots of helpful tutorials are here:	<a href="https://www.predix.io/resources/tutorials" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.predix.io/resources/tutorials</a></p>	"

Use token.access_token as a Bearer token Authroization header in calls to secured services.	once it securely calls service create websocket connection and start sending data to predix-time-series service</p>		<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/srinivasyl/8f85933a6ad86f6114c14b1267c4d129" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> sample code to achieve it</p>	"

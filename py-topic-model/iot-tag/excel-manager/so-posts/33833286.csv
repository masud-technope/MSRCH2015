This sensor is publishing data with <code>tempMeasurement</code> topic. The configuration of MQTT publisher is as follows:</p>		<pre><code>public class MQTTPublisher {		    // public static final String BROKER_URL =	    // "tcp://broker.mqttdashboard.com:1883";	    public static final String BROKER_URL = "tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883";		    private MqttClient client;		    public MQTTPublisher() {	        try {	            client = new MqttClient(BROKER_URL, MqttClient.generateClientId(),	                    new MemoryPersistence());	            client.connect();		        } catch (MqttException e) {	            e.printStackTrace();	        }	    }		    public void publish(String topicName, int qos, byte[] payload)	            throws MqttException {	        final MqttTopic topic = client.getTopic(topicName);		        final MqttMessage message = new MqttMessage(payload);	        topic.publish(message);		        System.out.println("Published data. Topic: " + topic.getName()	                + "  Message: " + payload);	    }	}	</code></pre>		<p>On the other side in Node-RED, I have created MQTT node, that has subscribe "tempMesurement". The configuration of MQTT node in NODE-RED is as follows: </p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ksFOY.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ksFOY.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ktir.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ktir.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>My problem is that MQTT subscriber node is showing <strong>disconnected</strong> message as show in the above figure. Could you please suggest - what is wrong with the configuration in NODE-RED? How can I resolve this issue?</p>	"

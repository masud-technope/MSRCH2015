These IBM services include a Python CF App and a Watson IoT service.</p>		<p>To get the Python board to talk to the IBM cloud, per IBM documentation I installed the following: </p>		<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i iot_1.0-2_armhf.deb	</code></pre>		<p>After I added the Raspberry PI to the IBM Watson IoT service in the Cloud, I stopped and restarted the service (sudo service iot start) on the Raspberry Pi and I could immediately see that the device connected to the IBM Cloud.</p>		<pre><code>Token auth succeeded: ClientID='d:xxxxx:raspberrypi:xxxxxxxx', ClientIP=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx	Dec 18, 2018 6:22 PM	</code></pre>		<p>What I did NOT expect was to see was messages being generated by the Raspberry Pi and flowing into the Cloud.  Ex:</p>		<pre><code>{	    "d": {	        "myName": "myPi",	        "cputemp": 44.01,	        "cpuload": 0.01,	        "sine": 0.38	    }	}	</code></pre>		<p>I can't find anything that talks about this.  I'd like to know:</p>		<ol>	<li>Is this a standard behaviour of the iot service on the Pi?</li>	<li>Where is the IBM documentation for this?  (I can't find it.)</li>	<li>Can I tap into this and use this in lieu of a client app that I am writing?</li>	<li>Where is message.txt at?</li>	</ol>		<p>I think of this service as a normal Windows or Linux service, I just did not expect it to act as an application.  </p>		<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>	"

I have located examples that use the PubSubClient library (<a href="https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/run-an-esp8266arduino-as-a-iot-foundation-managed-device/" rel="nofollow">https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/run-an-esp8266arduino-as-a-iot-foundation-managed-device/</a>) to do this, however, I have not yet found a working example of PubSubClient using TLS1.2 (a requirement for this project). As such I am currently using the Adafruit_MQTT_Client which can connect and publish to Watson using TLS1.2, but I have not had success subscribing to the platform. If anyone could suggest a way to connect, publish and subscribe to IBM Watson IoT platform using TLS1.2, it would be much appreciated!</p>	"

Maybe your subscription to the command topics for your device isn't correct, or maybe you haven't specified to IoTP that your device accepts commands."
39836382,67164267,39836382,3,0,Sun Oct 09 08:52:00 EDT 2016,2318649,"The docs for IoTP are available in bluemix here: https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/index.html look below Developing Devices->Device Management Protocol and Device Management Requests. Can't be any more specific with the information you have provided: "have not had success"."

After updating to esp8266 2.3.0 using the boards manager, I was successfully able to get the PubSubClient library using TLS 1.2 to connect, publish and subscribe to Watson IoT. I am now able to to successfully receive the requests I previously had not with the Adafruit_MQTT_Client."

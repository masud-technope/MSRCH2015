It looks like this: <a href="http://tinypic.com/r/2hgckz4/9" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://tinypic.com/r/2hgckz4/9</a>.</p>		<p>I have tried:</p>		<ul>	<li>The ConfigureMe Wi-Fi route: I can select the wireless network <em>but I cannot upload the certificate</em>. There is simply not a box to do it. The ConfigureMe screen looks like this: <a href="https://imgur.com/9sawJjS" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://imgur.com/9sawJjS</a>. When I press Configure, the button connects to Wi-Fi (I think) but then displays red flashes I guess because it can't securely connect to AWS. </li>	<li>The AWS IoT iOS app, which doesn't make any progress beyond the spinner when after connecting to the Wi-Fi network.</li>	<li>The Amazon Shopping app setup for Dash Buttons, which successfully connects via Bluetooth and emits some ultrasound pips, but then fails for an unspecified reason.</li>	</ul>		<p>Is my button too old? It seems to be missing the certificate upload box and the screen doesn't match the documentation. Is there any way I can get this button to connect to AWS IoT now?</p>	"

There is a special web page on the cloud to configure this particular button, I would suggest requesting the details back to the person which handed the button to you.</p>		<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>		<p>You can find details on how to associate your 1st generation button to your AWS account by following <a href="https://www.hackster.io/shivanshsingh/aws-cloud-enabled-burglar-alarm-ba1af1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this article</a> which also provides a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/iotbutton-getting-started/iot-button-getting-started.mp4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">video of the procedure</a>.</p>	"

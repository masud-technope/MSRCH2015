For next step, please help me how to use SignalR here to sendMessage- send this just_received_data_from_iot_hub - to UI	 Note : data is getting received continuously from IoT hub -- and that its inside the while loop	 	If I say SendMessage -  it will come out the while loop - which means stopped receiving data  from IoT Hub . Please suggest an way to implement this- am new to this so this may be a very basic Question -kindly excuse me for that."

Other than that, which would be a large overhead for a simple thing like this if security is a factor, you could either create a web api, or a mvc action that returns a JsonResult, and poll this every x seconds. </p>		<p>UPDATED:</p>		<p>Basically, you cant - You need real time processing for this.</p>		<p>With the while(true) loop, you are blocking the request thread, and it will never return. You could just poll a WebAPI/Json MVC controller that you get the latest message from the IoT Hub message queue.</p>		<ol>	<li><p>UI polls every X Seconds a WebAPI/MVC Json Action on your app sending the last recieved message id</p></li>	<li><p>The WebAPI/MVC Json Action get all messages from IoT Hub message queue > last message id</p></li>	<li><p>Send the new messages back to the client</p></li>	</ol>		<p>This will be a simple way to solve your issue, and will be as close to real time as you can get without WebSockets or Signal-R. (BTW, you can host Signal-R in a WebAPI/MVC app, you dont have to have in in a second app)</p>	"

Currently my app is saving the message as a json object and another new web app with jQuery displays that latest json value		It displays fine. But I know that is not an optimal solution -which uses 2 app		The SignalR send one value to the view	My mismatch here is that the value received from IoT Hub is inside while(true) loop 	My mismatch is here.		How to send a value to the UI when I am inside the while(loop) thats continuously receiving data from IoT Hub?"

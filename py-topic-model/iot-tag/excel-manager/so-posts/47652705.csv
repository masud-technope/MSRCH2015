How can I figure out the OS of the device(I only have its IP address) using any script/tool/service ? Any help would be immensely appreciated. I am new to this. Thanks.</p>	"

Shodan includes the operating system when possible and also gives you a lot of additional information to decide whether it's an IoT device or not. Here's some sample code in Python to get you started:</p>		<pre><code>from shodan import Shodan		# Setup the API connection	api = Shodan("YOUR API KEY") # Get it from https://account.shodan.io		# Lookup the IP information	host = api.host("66.96.212.7")		# If Shodan was able to identify the operating system then it will have	# an "os" property	if 'os' in host and host['os']:	    print(host['os'])		# You can also look at the list of ports running on the IP to determine	# whether it's an IoT device	print(host['ports'])		# Or you can look at the "tags" property as that sometimes includes an "iot" tag	print(host['tags'])	</code></pre>	"

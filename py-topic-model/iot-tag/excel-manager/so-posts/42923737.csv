Based on my understanding for your description, I can only give some idea for you.</p>		<ol>	<li><p>To turn LED on/off, you need a micro board as a controller, such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi, to receive the switching signal to control a relay which connect LED with Power Supply, or directly to switch the 3.3V/5V port of the board which connect LED if the LED is enough small.</p></li>	<li><p>For micro board device with Azure IoT Hub as below.</p>		<ul>	<li>Using Arduino in C/C++ to send device-to-cloud message as heartbeat to Azure IoT Hub for keeping connection &amp; online status, then be ready for receving cloud-to-device message as switching signal from Azure IoT Hub to do the action for switching LED.</li>	<li>Using Respberry Pi in Java with Oracle JDK for Linux ARM) or in C# on Windows IoT Core to do the same operations like Arduino above.</li>	</ul></li>	<li><p>Using Java to build a application for User Interface to communicate with Azure IoT Hub to send <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-java-java-c2d" rel="nofollow noreferrer">cloud-to-device</a> messages and check these device status.</p></li>	</ol>		<p>There are some sample which you can refer to, but not for Java.</p>		<ol>	<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-adafruit-feather-m0-wifi-kit-arduino-lesson4-change-led-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Change the on and off behavior of the LED</a> on Arduino.</li>	<li>Connect your Raspberry Pi 3 device to your IoT hub using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-c-get-started" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Node.js</a></li>	<li>Connect your Intel Edison device to your IoT hub using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-intel-edison-kit-node-get-started" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-intel-edison-kit-c-get-started" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C</a></li>	</ol>		<p>Hope it helps.

Our client is planning to use the zigbee sensors with the  DSR gateway manager .I want to know importantly as two things 1. Get the devices information from azure Iot using java ?2. I think based on the devices the Json parameters should be different for one device to another device while sending messages to azure Iot. I need to know the what and all parameters i need to send to azure IOT based on device?"

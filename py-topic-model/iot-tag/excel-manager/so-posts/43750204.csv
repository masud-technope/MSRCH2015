In this project I hava a Android Application and a IoT(NodeMCU 1.0) and I have found a way to send messages from the IoT Device to my android application using Azure, but now I have to send data from the Android application to the IoT device. the device is using IoT Hub to send information to Azure. </p>	"

You need to do two steps for implementing the needs.</p>		<p>First of all, there are two ways to implement for sending a cloud-to-device message to IoTHub.</p>		<ol>	<li><p>Directly sending data from Android App to IoTHub, you can refer to the section <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-java-java-c2d#send-a-cloud-to-device-message" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Send a cloud-to-device message</code></a> of the offical tutorial for Java to do it, but I think it's not a good idea to do it between Android and IoTHub that considering the concurrency requests for IoTHub come from android devices installed your app.</p></li>	<li><p>So per my experience, the better way is that create a Mobile App for Node.js which will handle the request from Android devices and forward the data to IoTHub via <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-node-node-c2d" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Send a cloud-to-device message</code> using Node.js</a>.</p></li>	</ol>		<p>Then, you can try to call the REST API <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/iothub/httpruntime#HttpRuntime_ReceiveDeviceBoundNotification" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Receive Device Bound Notification</a> using eLua or Arduino ino code at regular intervals on IoT devices to receive the c2d message, like the code in the section <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-node-node-c2d#receive-messages-in-the-simulated-device-app" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Receive messages in the simulated device app</code></a>.</p>		<p>Hope it helps.</p>	"

Isn't there a way to use Azure App Functions to do this, and this funtion receives the request from the Android App and then it sends the command to a IoT Hub Device?"

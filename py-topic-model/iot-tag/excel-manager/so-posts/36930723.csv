Just want to add one thing - Azure pricing estimation can be done through a pricing calculator, which should make it easier to understand: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/calculator/	And Azure supports all the services you mentioned - including your point 5 :)"

It starts out pretty cheap but as soon you want something to happen it seems to shoot away in price. I rather go for a service where i can have a better controll on the the cost. But thank you for your input."

As i can see it i should be able to use everything i want inside the reekoh platform? Any specific reason why i should use Reekoh and Mule?"

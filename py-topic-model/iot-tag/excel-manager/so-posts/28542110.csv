I have some appliance with Wi-Fi enabled controllers	 2. These controllers are connected to One Standard Router (ex:- CISCO,TP-Link, D-Link). All appliance connected to one router through Wi-Fi.	 3. These appliance controlled through local handheld devices by using our proprietary protocol with in the Home network.		Now, we want to give a one feature like operate these appliance by using Handheld device from Remotely.	</code></pre>		<p>Internet is enabled to this Router &amp; also register one domain name. 	   But our problem is how to send commands or data from remote devices through Internet to home appliances.</p>		<p><strong><em>Note:-</em></strong><br>	 1.I donâ€™t want to develop or place controller between IoT devices &amp;	        Remote handheld devices.	 2. Request is initiated by remote handheld device only.</p>		<p>I hope, any body can guide to me for better solution. </p>		<p>Thanks in advance</p>	"

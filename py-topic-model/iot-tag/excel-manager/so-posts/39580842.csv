I'm trying to run a TCPListener on my RPi, code runs with no exception but never can connect it, seems that some things block my connection. there is no hardware or software Firewall in path. I tried both background and foreground app but no result.</p>		<p>My code is as below :</p>		<pre><code>namespace TestBackPort	{	public sealed class StartupTask : IBackgroundTask	{	    public void Run(IBackgroundTaskInstance taskInstance)	    {	        TcpListener tcpListener = null;		        tcpListener = new TcpListener(IPAddress.Parse("192.168.1.9"), 1100);	        tcpListener.Start();	        var task = HandleConnectionsAsync(tcpListener);	        task.Wait();		    }		    int connectionNumber = 0;	    async Task HandleConnectionsAsync(TcpListener listener)	    {	        while (true)	        {	            var client = await listener.AcceptTcpClientAsync();	            // Console.WriteLine("OK #" + connectionNumber);	            connectionNumber++;	        }	    }	  }	}	</code></pre>	"

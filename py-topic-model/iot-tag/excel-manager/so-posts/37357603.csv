37357603,37357603,null,1,1,Sat May 21 00:16:00 EDT 2016,2897452,"<p>Hello i am using face recognition with open cv. The code is from <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/tutorial/facerec_video_recognition.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I use my web cam with the raspberry pi and the recognition is ok. When i put my photo in front of the camera then it still detect me. </p>		<p>My questions is how can i check if the face is a real and not an image. I want to use it for smart home door lock/unlock and i dont want anyone with any photo to open the door. Or can i do something with other sensors to ensure that is the real person? Thank you.</p>	"

On thing that would make this harder to fake would be verifying the background -- does it match with what your camera usually sees? The next step would be working in 3D - LIDAR seems impractical for this purpose, but perhaps stereo vision (2 cameras) could discern between a real 3D person and a photo."

Some things that come to mind are a fingerprint scan, voice recognition, IR (a picture won't radiate heat like a real person), perhaps even a paired Bluetooth device. Every additional (and independent) test significantly increases the space an attacker would have to search (or replicate) in order to break the algorithm. Note that those are just opinions, I have no experience in this specific area."

I would be suprised if they would consider such device as a sufficient enough security measure without passing some strict tests/certifications. But again, this is just a guess based on my intuition."

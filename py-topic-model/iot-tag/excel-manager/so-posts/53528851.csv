To complete the project, I will be using two VL53L0X sensors to detect the direction of movement. To get me started, I purchased an X-CUBE-53L0A1 and loaded on the sample code project onto the Nucleo F401RE and was able to successfully do gesture detection and range detection.</p>		<p>Because this project needs to be low power, I've been trying to port the program over to one of the low power versions of your Nucleo range, more specifically, the STM32L432KC board. I attempted to follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU4jivUZJm8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this tutorial</a> for moving the program from one board to another, and was not able to complete the process.</p>		<p>I am trying to get the gesture detection, and range detection samples provided <a href="https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/Getting-started-with-NUCLEO-F401RE-and-mbedOS" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> to work on the STM32L432KC Nucleo board through the I2C interface. Once I change the target board in Keil uVision the compiler throws tons of errors. </p>		<p>If anyone has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>	"

"Once I change the target board in Keil uVision the compiler throws tons of errors." - post the errors please. It's best to follow the 'I expect this, but this happens instead [post detailed errors and relevant code fragments that allow to reproduce the problem]' format to increase your chance of getting a detailed answer."

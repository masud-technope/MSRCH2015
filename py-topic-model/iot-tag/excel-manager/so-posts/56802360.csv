It uses Cognito based authentication to do IoT calls. We are noticing that till the app is active the SDK seems to refresh the token expiry time. However, when the app is in the background for a longer duration (> 1 hr), the IoT connection does not reestablish which seems to be because of expiration of Cognito token. Also, it seems the callbacks are not fired in that case.</p>		<p>What is the good way to handle Cognito expiration time in such cases and in general what is the right way to handle IoT connectivity established using aws-iot-device-sdk?</p>		<p>Links to aws-iot-device-sdk: <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js</a></p>	"

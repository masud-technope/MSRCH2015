I have the data of GPS module, but I am confused about how to upload the data on cloud. I have a little idea that I can do this with GSM module by sending one https request.	But I have a doubt that when I am doing the HTTPS GET request then I am getting the html code of the website. Which is not of my use. 	Is there any other module to do so. Or I am doing something wrong with GET request. Please help me with this.	Every help is welcomed.</p>	"

The IoT devices will use device SDK to communicate with cloud. Once the data is captured by IoT Hub, you can manage the instance using service SDKs. This data can further be transformed by other services like Stream Analytics, etc.</p>		<p>Resources: </p>		<p>Connecting to IoT Hub: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/iot/get-started/" rel="nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/iot/get-started/</a></p>		<p>SDKs: <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks</a></p>	"

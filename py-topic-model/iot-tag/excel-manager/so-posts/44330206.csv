For some reason it doesn't allow me to publish the app when I use a maker webhook in it.I'm not sure why it doesn't allow me or if it's even possible at all. </p>		<p>There isn't any error in the applet either as it works perfectly fine in private mode. I also have seen some applets by other users that use the maker webhooks in their applet. So I think it must be possible.</p>		<p>If somebody could answer this question who has published an applet before with webhooks or what I could be doing wrong. Thanks in advance ! </p>	"

I can publish any other combo of services, but from the moment I use maker webhooks the publish button is grayed-out. I don't think there is anything wrong with the applet settings and I didn't add any filter code. It only says "This Applet is private and uses one or more services that prevent it from being published""

We connected a robot capable of showing emotions to IFTTT services. Every time a service got triggered, the robot showed an emotion and said a message accordingly to the service. We managed to do without a partner account as a proof of concept for the partner account was a tad bit too expensive for us for now."

I am not sure how to make a IoT framework , suppose i have four or five IoT sensors are being used in a manfucturing environment than how can i use them to create a framework on cloud such google or Azure etc.	Can anybody comment on it . much appreciated 	Nhqazi</p>	"

There are different cloud providers which offers services dedicated for IoT solutions, for instance:</p>		<ol>	<li>Microsoft Azure cloud offers: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Azure IoT Hub</a></li>	<li>Amazon offers: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">AWS IoT</a></li>	<li>Google offers: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/iot/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google Cloud IoT</a></li>	</ol>		<p>Now each of theese service offers some tools to integrate them with IoT devices. This is I think what you are talking about. For instance Microsoft provides <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-sdks" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Azure IoT Hub SDK</a> so you can use it to send data from your device to the cloud and from the cloud to the device.</p>		<p>Now if you have devices and sensors you can intgrate them with cloud services mentioned above. Here you can see how I integrated Raspberry PI2 device and motion sensor with Azure IoT Hub from Microsoft:</p>		<p><a href="https://daniel-krzyczkowski.github.io/cloudyofthings/article1/index" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://daniel-krzyczkowski.github.io/cloudyofthings/article1/index</a></p>	"

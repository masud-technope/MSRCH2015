Earlier I replicated Parking Lot App as shown in the document on <a href="https://iotwb.mybluemix.net/images/pdfFiles/IoT_Workbench_Tutorial_NodeJS_v1.2.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>. that time the app worked fine. Now when i try to replicate the same app again I see the code structure is changed. the "mqtt" folder which was there previously is missing/omitted from the code. I am unable to find the callbacks which were there in files under "mqtt" folder.	I checked the above mentioned doc if its modified, but it is still the old doc which is there since March.</p>		<p>can someone guide me on this?</p>		<p>folder structure before :</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wf4Di.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wf4Di.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>folder stucture after : </p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7gL3Q.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7gL3Q.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>	"

Older applications that used the old code the workbench will still use the old scheme and will not be affected.	The document of the parking finder sample will be updated in the next few days for reflect the changes.</p>		<p>The new scheme introduce many improvements like:	-Simpler handling of mqtt events and commands,	-Simpler handling of http messages	- More options to add user code  </p>	"

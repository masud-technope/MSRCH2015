Here is how I produced a timestamp in a function node:</p>		<pre><code>var tstamp=(new Date).toISOString().replace(/t/gi,' ').trim();	</code></pre>		<p>To add a timestamp depending on the device timezone you would need to know where the device is located. This might be even more complex if the device is mobile.</p>	"

You can also see here, on how to [authorize request with Oath 2.0](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/auth). Check also this [tutorial](https://blog.tsheets.com/2014/business-help/using-oauth-2-0-to-authenticate-with-rest-ful-web-apis) for more information and if it can help you."

I need a kind of server-to-server authentication scheme, but without interaction from the user, as it is a device which access google calendar api."

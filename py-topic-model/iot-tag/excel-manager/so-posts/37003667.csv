The task is to read a rfid card and to send its unique id number to a webpage (coded in php) which stores the data in a database. We sent at commands to the module from arduino ide serial monitor through a uno board. We used <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZgQt1.png" rel="nofollow">Serial_op</a>http POST method first to send the read rfid number to the webpage. As that attempt was a failure we tried using GET method. But neither of those methods worked.</p>		<pre><code>    &lt;?php	    error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_DEPRECATED);	    $dbhost = 'localhost';	    $dbuser = 'root';	    $dbpass = '';	    $conn = mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass);	    if(! $conn ) {	    die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());	    }	    $Data=$_GET['Data'];	    //$Data='Data test';	    echo "Data is :" . $Data;	    $sql = "INSERT INTO test_tab (Data) VALUES ('$Data')";	    mysql_select_db('robot');	    $retval = mysql_query( $sql, $conn );	    if(! $retval ) {	    die('Could not enter data: ' . mysql_error());	    }   	    echo "Entered data successfully\n";	    mysql_close($conn);	    ?&gt;	</code></pre>	"

37003667,37006957,37003667,2,0,Tue May 03 14:27:00 EDT 2016,4789526,"<p>You are missing a few <code>\r\n</code> and the length you are giving to your <code>AT+CIPSEND</code> is incorrect.</p>		<p>Try sending this instead:</p>		<pre><code>AT+CIPSEND=43\r\n	GET /test.php?Data=2\r\nHost:192.168.1.13\r\n\r\n	</code></pre>		<p>To send <code>\r\n</code> just hit <code>Enter</code>. Make sure that <code>"Both NL &amp; CR"</code> is selected in your serial monitor. At the end, yes you hit <code>Enter</code> twice.</p>		<p>Here I am sending the value 2.</p>		<p>Here how I get the 43 length:	You take the size of your GET (we have 49) and you subtract 1 for each <code>\r</code> or <code>\n</code>. Because they are just one character. So we have <code>49 - 6 = 43</code>.</p>		<p>Please, make sure to try to send a value directly from the URL to verify that your PHP script is working fine. Fix any possible error before trying to send data through ESP8266.</p>		<p><strong><em>Side Note:</em></strong> It is not recommended to use the API mysql, as it is deprecated and removed from new versions of php.

I tested the code connecting to my phone(as an Access Point) In my workplace we have another working WiFi router for internet. Whenever I turn on my WiFi module the WiFi router's WiFi link gets disconnected even if the module is connected to my phone. What could be the reason? @Ouss4"

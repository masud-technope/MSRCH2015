I am wondering what the difference between the two classes "device" and "thingShadow" are. This <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js/blob/master/README.md" rel="nofollow noreferrer">library</a> gives examples of both and they both seem to have similar functionalities. </p>	"

44910791,44960784,44910791,2,8,Fri Jul 07 00:32:00 EDT 2017,1175633,"<p>The <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js#device-class" rel="noreferrer">device class</a> is used to subscribe to and publish messages on MQTT topics for telemetry and messaging purposes.</p>		<p>The <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js#thing-shadow-class" rel="noreferrer">thingShadow class</a> is a <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js/blob/master/thing/index.js#L23" rel="noreferrer">wrapper around the device class</a>, which provides additional methods such as <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js#register" rel="noreferrer"><code>.register</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js#awsiotthingshadowupdatethingname-stateobject" rel="noreferrer"><code>.update</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js#awsiotthingshadowdeletethingname-clienttoken" rel="noreferrer"><code>delete</code></a> which are designed to interact with a device shadow. This class also emits specific events associated with a shadow lifecycle such as <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js#event-status" rel="noreferrer"><code>status</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js#event-delta" rel="noreferrer"><code>delta</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js#event-foreignstatechange" rel="noreferrer"><code>foreignStateChange</code></a>.</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>[...] the thingShadow class allows devices to update, be notified of changes to, get the current state of, or delete Thing Shadows from AWS IoT.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>So basically, if you're using device shadows use the <code>thingShadow</code> class, otherwise you can use the <code>device</code> class.</p>		<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>		<p>To expand a bit more on the basic principles of AWS IoT, you have two communication scheme between devices:</p>		<ul>	<li><p>Since AWS IoT implements a standard <a href="http://mqtt.org/" rel="noreferrer">MQTT</a> interface, you can use topics to communicate with your devices using a pattern called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern" rel="noreferrer">publish-subscribe</a>. Your apps can subscribe to a topic and wait for a device to publish a message on it. Similarly, your app can publish a message on a device topic and have the device receive it.</p></li>	<li><p>AWS IoT implements a second communication interface called the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-thing-shadows.html" rel="noreferrer">device shadow</a>, which allows you to address a device even when it is disconnected, and keep a synchronized state between your app and the device itself. The AWS documentation explains it in clear terms.</p></li>	</ul>		<blockquote>	  <p>A thing shadow (sometimes referred to as a device shadow) is a JSON	  document that is used to store and retrieve current state information	  for a thing (device, app, and so on). The Thing Shadows service	  maintains a thing shadow for each thing you connect to AWS IoT. You	  can use thing shadows to get and set the state of a thing over MQTT or	  HTTP, regardless of whether the thing is connected to the Internet.	  Each thing shadow is uniquely identified by its name.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>The two interfaces can be addressed in the SDK using the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js#device-class" rel="noreferrer">device class</a> for subscribing and publishing on MQTT topics, and the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js#thing-shadow-class" rel="noreferrer">thing shadow class</a> to retrieve, update or delete a device thing shadow document.</p>	"

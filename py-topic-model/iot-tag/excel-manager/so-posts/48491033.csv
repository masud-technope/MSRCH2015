48491033,48491033,null,1,0,Sun Jan 28 20:37:00 EST 2018,9050798,"<p>I have a gateway which catches LoRa packets(decrypted with AES-128 and encoded as base64) and converts them to UDP.	In addition, i execute a service on my gateway (lora-gateway-bridge: <a href="https://github.com/brocaar/lora-gateway-bridge" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/brocaar/lora-gateway-bridge</a>) which abstracts the UDP protocol and converts my packet to MQTT.	On cloud,the packets are published as they are to the mosquitto MQTT broker in JSON format which includes the gateway's metadata and the phypayload as key value pairs. 	I also run the Fiware's JSON/MQTT IOT agent service and the Context Broker.	What should i do in order to send the measures from the mosquitto to the IOT agent in order to be compatible?	For example i want to make a post request to iotagent service to send the measure of the temperature and humidity....these are published until now to the mosquitto as </p>		<pre><code>gateway/1dee18c14948a955/rx {"rxInfo":	{"mac":"1dee18c14948a955","time":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":38099540,	"frequency":868500000,"channel":2,"rfChain":1,"crcStatus":1,"codeRate":"4/5",	"rssi":-28,"loRaSNR":9,"size":20,"dataRate":{"modulation":"LORA","spreadFactor":9,	"bandwidth":125}},"phyPayload":"gFY0EjoAAgABCCpbg+AkKM1gHnQ="}	</code></pre>		<p>Essentially i want to send to my IOT agent the decrypted frame payload that the phypayload includes,which is 006700ED016866 HEX.This means that the temperature is 00ED(HEX) and the humidity 66(HEX) according the cayenne low power payload format.	Then i had to post to the IOT agent the temperature t:23,7 and the humidity h:54</p>	"

Now in my mqtt broker i publish the decrypted and decoded cayenne low power payload.Now what should i do in order this format be readable from one of the fiware's mqtt IOT agents? Tell me your email if you want to attach you a screenshot with the published mqtt topics."

A new Agent for that is incoming."

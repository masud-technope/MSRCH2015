I close some services including autoupdate service, push message service, and the network costs reduce to 400+k a day. But I still can see the IOT device send receive data from "umwatson.traffic.net", some data packages are nearly 5000 bytes long. My question is what that site is for, and how can I set the system to avoid send receive data from that address?</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dSVUP.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dSVUP.png" alt="Message analyzer screen shot"></a></p>	"

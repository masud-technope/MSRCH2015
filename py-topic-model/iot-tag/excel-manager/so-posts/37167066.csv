On the specifications I only found descriptions about the LwM2M client and the resources that it can contain but I found nothing on the server side besides the interfaces that it shall support. 	(I mean it should somewhere store the list of the registred client for example..)</p>		<p>Any ideas where I can find information about the LwM2M server?</p>	"

Does it make sense? </p>	"

Am I right? Thanks"

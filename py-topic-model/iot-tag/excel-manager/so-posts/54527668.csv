It's all working apart from Google Calender code. I wrote a desktop UWP app that successfully downloads google calendar data. When I tried to port it to the IoT core UWP project I was unable to install the Google api nuget packages. I get the error:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>Error NU1202  Package Google.Apis.Auth.AspNetCore 1.38.0 is not compatible with uap10.0.10586 (UAP,Version=v10.0.10586) / win10-arm-aot. Package Google.Apis.Auth.AspNetCore 1.38.0 supports: netstandard2.0 (.NETStandard,Version=v2.0)</p>	</blockquote>		<p>Is this just not supported or there is there something I can change or upgrade?</p>	"

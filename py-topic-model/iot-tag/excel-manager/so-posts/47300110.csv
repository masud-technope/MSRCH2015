Err: You must give at least one requirement to install (see "pip help install")</p>		<p>You need to run this on the Raspberry PI:</p>		<p>sudo pip install twilio</p>		<p>If you don't have pip installed then run:</p>		<p>sudo apt-get install python3-pip</p>		<p>and then again: sudo pip install twilio</p>		<p>for 2.

My python version is 2.7.9 now. And about defind account_sid, auth_token, should i put real code for both of them? Thanks"

On step 33 it say that you need to install some requirements as below:		sudo pip install -r requirements.txt		The file can be found on this repo:		https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/python-iot-raspberry-pi"

(Ubuntu or centos VM ).

To summarize, there is no generic installer for Ubuntu, Fedora, or CentOS. Kura has dependencies on both the OS and CPU architecture. The supported platforms are:</p>		<ul>	<li>Raspberry Pi based on Raspbian: Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi B+,	Raspberry Pi 2/3</li>	<li>BeagleBone Black based on Debian</li>	<li>Fedora 25 ARM</li>	<li>Intel Edison</li>	</ul>		<p>The "No Net" versions of the posted installers will remove most of the OS dependencies. For CPU architectures, if you are using something other than ARMv6 HF or x86_64, you will need to compile the native libraries. The minimum native library needed for Kura to start is <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/kura/tree/develop/kura/org.eclipse.kura.linux.usb/src/main/c/udev" rel="nofollow noreferrer">udev</a>. </p>	"

44027532,75504345,44137756,3,0,Mon May 29 17:44:00 EDT 2017,1170843,"As per you "No Net" version of the above installers will work on x86_64 architecture as well.    Let's say we have Intel Core i-5 computer with ubuntu or centos, the architecture is x86_64. What is the installer, that we need to install ? Is it BeagleBone black based on Debian ??"
44027532,75627587,44137756,3,1,Thu Jun 01 15:02:00 EDT 2017,5029050,"The only installer that uses the x86_64 native libs is the Intel Edison installer."

I installed the latest version of python from python website. But my friend who had learned python before suggested me  to install the stable version of python i.e. 3.6.x. </p>		<p>Please help me with which version to choose and why should I choose it and how installing the latest version cause trouble.</p>		<p>Thank you.. </p>	"
54634930,96062073,54634930,3,5,Mon Feb 11 16:29:00 EST 2019,3890632,"Python 3.7.2 is the latest stable version. Use that. It's nifty."
54634930,96062118,54634930,3,0,Mon Feb 11 16:30:00 EST 2019,7932273,"I am not sure python 3.7 supports libraries like `Tensorflow`. I would suggest Python 3.6 here."
54634930,96062251,54634930,3,2,Mon Feb 11 16:34:00 EST 2019,5580553,"No, it's not that python 3.7 doesn't support some libraries, it's that some libraries don't support python 3.7 (yet). Also this right here is a great example of why we don't allow questions that attract opinionated answers."
54634930,96062449,54634930,3,0,Mon Feb 11 16:39:00 EST 2019,3058609,"@FynnBecker this isn't an opinion-based question any more than "How should I parse HTML in Python." There are several solutions, but there are reasoned explanations for each. An opinion-based question would be "What's the best HTML parser in Python," or "What's the best version of Python.""
54634930,96062467,54634930,3,0,Mon Feb 11 16:39:00 EST 2019,1126841,"@AkshayNevrekar That assumes you need to use libraries like Tensorflow. For the question as stated, which is to learn Python, use the latest stable version."
54634930,96062486,54634930,3,1,Mon Feb 11 16:40:00 EST 2019,3058609,"@chepner ehhhh it's also tagged with [tag:artificial-intelligence] which kind of presumes Tensorflow"
54634930,96062509,54634930,3,0,Mon Feb 11 16:40:00 EST 2019,7932273,"@AdamSmith Exactly my point."
54634930,96062560,54634930,3,3,Mon Feb 11 16:42:00 EST 2019,1126841,"Just because it's a useful library doesn't make it *necessary* to study either AI or ML. Besides, learning the language is far more important than learning any particular library or framework."

Which would be the best for starting.	PS:- I am not working on any project right now."
54634930,96062579,54634930,3,0,Mon Feb 11 16:42:00 EST 2019,5580553,"@AdamSmith I'm not saying it is an opinion-based question in itself, I'm saying it attracts opinionated answers. As proven above, `tensorflow` is already assumed while there are other viable libraries."
54634930,96062608,54634930,3,0,Mon Feb 11 16:43:00 EST 2019,3058609,"@FynnBecker ehhh you're splitting hairs with the syntax."
54634930,54635226,54634930,2,1,Mon Feb 11 16:42:00 EST 2019,3058609,"<p>As a general rule, when starting a new project you should work on the <strong>latest version of Python that all your dependencies support.</strong></p>		<p>Since we don't know what your project is, all we can do is guess based on how you tagged the question. Including <a href="/questions/tagged/artificial-intelligence" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;artificial-intelligence&#39;" rel="tag">artificial-intelligence</a> makes me think you'll probably be using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Tensorflow</a> (a Machine Learning library) which only supports Python 3.6.</p>	"

I am only in	learning stage.I referred a document which have implemented the COAP sample 	in eclipse by using californium. In that, I tried the example provided in the 	document to observe the server states continuously, but it is not working in 	it just shows null pointer exception while I am running the project. Then I tried to debug the code for what is the reason for null pointer exception, it is 	running good its getting the result continuously, I don't understand why it is 	producing error during running the project but during debug its not. Please help </p>		<p>The code I am using is:  </p>		<pre><code>public class HelloObserver {		    public static void main(String[] args) {	         CoapClient client = new CoapClient("coap://vs0.inf.ethz.ch:5683/obs");		         CoapObserveRelation relation=    client.observe(new CoapHandler() {			                @Override	                public void onLoad(CoapResponse response) {		                    System.out.println(response.getResponseText());	                    /*response.notify();*/	                    // TODO Auto-generated method stub		                }		                @Override	                public void onError() {	                    System.err.println();	                    // TODO Auto-generated method stub		                }	            });		         relation.proactiveCancel();	    }		}	</code></pre>	"

After you have setup your observe relation you need to make sure your program is still doing something, e.g. a while(true) where you sleep for 10 secs and send a ping, or something like that.</p>		<p>You may want to have a look at how it's done in <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/californium/blob/master/api-demo/src/org/eclipse/californium/examples/CoAPClientExample.java" rel="nofollow">this example</a> where essentially the program terminates when a key is pressed.</p>	"

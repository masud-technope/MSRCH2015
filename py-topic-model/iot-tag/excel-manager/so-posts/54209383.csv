Within the dashboard, there's a button to start the debugger, but it returns an error that the debugger must be copied over to the Pi before it can be started.</p>		<p>I can't deploy because it's not active and I can't start it because I haven't deployed anything yet.</p>		<p>How do I fix this catch 22?</p>	"

When I start the debugger via device portal the exact error message is:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>Failed to start the Visual Studio Remote Debugger. The Remote Debugger	  needs to be copied to the device. This can be done by deploying an	  application to the device using Visual Studio.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>So you can reference "<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/develop-your-app/appdeployment" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Deploying an App with Visual Studio</a>" tutorial to see if it helps. It works for me.</p>		<ul>	<li>With the application open in Visual Studio, set the architecture in the toolbar dropdown. For Raspberry Pi 3, select ARM.</li>	<li>Next, in the Visual Studio toolbar, click on the Local Machine dropdown and select Remote Machine.</li>	</ul>		<p>After deploying from Visual Studio successfully, you will start the debugger from device portal successfully. <strong>But no need to start debugger via device portal if you use visual studio debug/deploy.</strong></p>	"

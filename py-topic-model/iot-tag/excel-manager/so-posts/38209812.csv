I was looking at the wireless solutions at Monnit.com but they only record down to the nearest second, I need to record into miliseconds to estimate the box length.  I'm familiar with Node and have been looking at Johnny 5.  Is there support for something like this with Johnny 5 and the Arduino Raspberry Pi stack?  If so, any suggestions on hardware/API to get me started would be great, I'm completely new to the hardware/electronics side.</p>	"

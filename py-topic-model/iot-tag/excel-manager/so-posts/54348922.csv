I am able to successfully send the built-in action for Reboot/Reset, from the console to esp8266. However, when I try to send the reboot command from NodeRed application to esp8266, it does not work. Where am I going wrong? </p>		<p>Here is my NodeRed application snapshot <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/foxNY.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Node Red Application</a></p>		<p>Also below is the configuration of each node </p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P1J9K.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IBM Watson IoT configuration Node</a></p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ddVlg.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IBM Watson Inject Node</a></p>		<p>My device code is exactly the same as <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/run-an-esp8266arduino-as-a-iot-foundation-managed-device/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">esp8266 as managed device</a> except the few config parameters like Device Id and Device Type and Wifi credentials. </p>	"

Check the node configuration - the pencil for the api key and scroll down for rest of the panel you show - to remove the red triangle. </p>		<p>Once you have got rid of the red triangle and you are still not seeing any commands sent, and you have followed the set-up instructions then it may be that you are missing the security settings step. On the Watson IOT platform select <code>security &gt; policies &gt; connection security</code> Then set the appropriate option.</p>	"

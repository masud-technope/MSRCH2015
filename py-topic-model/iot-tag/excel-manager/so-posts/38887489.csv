I have 5 secure domains that I need to log all traffic to and from. I can get any new hardware/software needed, but I need to basically store all activity and then use a service to upload remotely for comparison on the server side.</p>		<p>Any great suggestions on best approaches for this? I can't install a proxy on the device, so Charles/Wireshark (my regular go-tos) are out. I can buy a router and setup DD-WRT or something, or just root a laptop with a special brew of linux.</p>		<p>Please advise. I need to get the setup put together as quickly as possible. Trying to debug a serious problem.</p>	"

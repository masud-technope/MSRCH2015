Or do you want to read sensors, control motors with a Cordova application? In any case, Win 10 IoT is made for IoT and anything else is a very low priority."

Your comment helped me change directions quickly. I had been researching and was curious, but the more I looked around, the more I realized that it would not be possible based on the purpose of phone gap, and IoT. Maybe in the future it will be easier to do. Thanks for you help."

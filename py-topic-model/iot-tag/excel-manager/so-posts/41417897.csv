The app will run in the background. </p>		<p>Lets assume the iBeacon is equipped with an internet connection as well. Will the beacon be able to pick up the data transmitted from the smartphone app?</p>		<p>What I'm trying to achieve is this:</p>		<ol>	<li>An IoT device works as an iBeacon (and motion sensor)</li>	<li>The IoT device picks up motion via the sensor</li>	<li>The IoT contacts a remote server to find out if a given smartphone is within close range of it.</li>	<li>The IoT performs some sort of operation based upon if the smartphone is close or not.</li>	</ol>		<p>Would this be possible?</p>	"

This is a very common use case, and I have built several apps that do this.</p>		<p>No, an iBeacon cannot send data to a server for two reasons:</p>		<ol>	<li><p>An iBeacon is a transmit only device.  It does nothing more than regularly send out an advertisement packet with a unique identifier.  By design, it does not listen or receive. While you could certainly build some other custom Bluetooth LE device that does this, it would not be a standard iBeacon.</p></li>	<li><p>Typically iBeacon devices do not have internet connections.</p></li>	</ol>		<p>What you describe is certainly possible if you build a general purpose computer with an internet connection that also sends out an iBeacon transmission as a small part of what it does.  I have built such systems out of Raspberry Pi computers, and stationary Android/iOS devices.  But you could also do this with a laptop, desktop, or smaller embedded device.</p>		<p>The key distinction in being able to do this is recognizing that you can't just buy an off-the-shelf iBeacon and make this work.  You have to build your own IoT device based on a small computer with an internet connection that is augmented to transmit an iBeacon advertisement.</p>	"

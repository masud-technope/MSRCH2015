As I can see the AWS one uses CMake as opposed to ESP-IDF which uses "old-style" <code>component.mk</code> (I'm not sure how it is called).</p>		<p>I tried using <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/feature/cmake" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ESP-IDF cmake branch</a> and configuring stuff together with no luck. It is all vague to me.</p>		<p>Other way could be to migrate AWS C++ SDK onto the ESP-IDF's "old-style" platform. I'd prefer this as there are other libs using this style so that they don't have to be ported.</p>		<p>Question, which way to go? How to do it? What are the steps to accomplish this?</p>		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>		<p>I've decided to go for the ESP-IDF / "old-style" way. What I've done so far is to create folder <code>components/aws-iot</code> where I cloned the AWS-SDK, created a <code>component.mk</code> <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/components/aws_iot" rel="nofollow noreferrer">similarly to this</a>, with the following content:</p>		<pre><code>COMPONENT_ADD_INCLUDEDIRS := aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp/include aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp/network/OpenSSL /usr/local/opt/openssl/include	COMPONENT_SRCDIRS := aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp/src	COMPONENT_SUBMODULES := aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp	</code></pre>		<p>I took the PubSub example and copied it into my project's main folder. When I'm compiling it throws an error: <code>components/aws-iot/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp/network/OpenSSL/OpenSSLConnection.hpp:41:25: fatal error: openssl/err.h: No such file or directory	compilation terminated.</code></p>		<p>Note that I added OpenSSL's include dir but it seems to be ignoring it. Any idea? Thanks.</p>	"

The ESP toolkit has example [AWS IoT](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/protocols/aws_iot) code that works well."

The device needs to scan for his network and connect to it somehow once it boots. He won't be able to plug in any keyboard, mouse or display. 	There is probably a better way to do this, but what about this? </p>		<p>Is there some existing way to have the Pi create an ad-hoc network, which allows my phone to connect to it directly by selecting it as a wireless network, and then somehow get a mobile app on my phone to share his home network's SSID and password? </p>		<p>In other words, </p>		<ul>	<li>Pi creates ad hoc network "MyPi"</li>	<li>User switches mobile phone wifi network to "MyPi"</li>	<li>With phone connected to Pi, Pi scans for networks and user picks network, enters password via mobile app</li>	<li>Pi tries to connect to the home network with the password</li>	</ul>	"

I have never tested whether or not it is possible, but it should be.</p>	"
37314289,62193103,37337292,3,0,Fri May 20 04:27:00 EDT 2016,1325863,"Good idea. Or maybe I could program the Pi to scan for a specific network named "Phone" and send him instructions on how to set up a hotspot on his phone named "Phone" and set a prescribed password.  Once the Pi powers up and finds the "Phone" hotspot, it'll use the password to hook up. I'l try it."

If not, is there a framework or another way to do it? </p>	"

The first problem you'd encounter is that there's no equivalent of a "light client". Each node needs to run a resource-intensive Java process with a 200mb+ heap size.</p>		<p>As a first step in addressing this, Corda has published design docs for Project Maximus, which would allow different users to "time-share" a single node. This would mean that each user would only have to run a client, instead of a full node. You can find the Maximus design doc here: <a href="https://groups.io/g/corda-dev/topic/27242114#469" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://groups.io/g/corda-dev/topic/27242114#469</a>.</p>	"

I want a mathematical function to compute the processing latency , I looked for the solution but I found nothing</p>	"

In an applied setting where you want to know the actual performance of a system, <strong>latency is measured, not computed</strong>. Real-world latencies tend to be statistical distributions rather than numbers, so the most relevant formulas may be for statistical analysis of the measurements (say, the 99th-percentile latency).</p>		<p>A formula can make sense when you know all the steps along the way. The <a href="http://www.rfwireless-world.com/calculators/Network-Latency-Calculator.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Network Latency Calculator</a> expresses latency as the sum of the time it takes a packet to travel between a source and destination (most relevant over long distances) and the time it takes the sending system to prepare the packet:</p>		<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?latency&space;=&space;delay_%7Bpropagation%7D&space;&plus;&space;delay_%7Bserialization%7D&space;=&space;%5Cfrac%7Bdistance_%7Bspatial%7D[m]%7D%7Bspeed_%7Bspatial%7D[m/s]%7D&space;&plus;&space;%5Cfrac%7Bsize_%7Bpacket%7D[bits]%7D%7Brate_%7Btransmission%7D[bps]%7D" title="latency = delay_{propagation} + delay_{serialization} = \frac{distance_{spatial}[m]}{speed_{spatial}[m/s]} + \frac{size_{packet}[bits]}{rate_{transmission}[bps]}" /></p>		<p>And that is just in one direction. This might not seem relevant to processing latency, yet it illustrates a fraction of the complexity that could be involved if this unknown cloud server makes calls to a database or other service. Uncertainty around even one variable throws the result into question. So the question is what you really need to measure.</p>		<ul>	<li>If interested in latency from a user perspective, use client-side tools that analyze times between request and response.</li>	<li>If measuring internal steps inside code you control, log event timestamps or the differences between them.</li>	<li>If looking for more granular results across cloud systems, access cloud logs that track events across multiple systems.</li>	</ul>	"

I am investigating ways for the gateway to discover all the sensors in the network, in my case the sensors are immobile and are static. </p>	"

You set the pi as the sink and all the data will automatically find its way to the sink.  So you could have all sensors sending some pairing code and when the pi receives it it has effectively detected that sensor.  http://contiki.sourceforge.net/docs/2.6/a00010.html"

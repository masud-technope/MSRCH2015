Most of the devices  are drop-shipped, but sometimes we get requests to provision them in advance. (ensure connectivity, etc). </p>		<p>Tonight it dawned upon me that I used to be able to read and write SIM information in the 2G pre-iPhone era, over a decade ago, and I wonder if it's still an option.</p>		<p>(the orders we're fulfilling want SIM cards inserted before we ship the devices out, generally) </p>		<p>I'm wondering if there's a way to write data like an APN to a SIM card directly so it's on the right regional carrier (I'm looking at YOU, Verizon!) or set other values before a cellular connection even happens by just plugging the SIM cards into an array of USB adapters and scripting it.</p>		<p>I figured out the reading part, but I can't find a way to write data to a SIM that's LTE/4G.</p>		<p>Anyone know more than I do about U.S. SIM access on the command line?</p>		<p>We use a solid mix of everything based on customer. AT&amp;T, Verizon dynamic, Verizon Public Static, Private Static, T-Mobile, You name it, I just want to be able to retrieve the information from the SIM cards we get in batches of up to thousands at a time and script something. Connection-checking each unit by hand is a stupid waste of man hours.</p>	"

Given 1) no detail of the card and 2) no detail of the interface device 3) no information about what you tried and 4) no information about the nature of failure you don't really have a question within the rules of SO."

I've done some research and it says it is difficult to detect proximity with a Bluetooth sensor but can I overcome this through using multiple Bluetooth beacons? The point is you can use multiple Bluetooth beacons to triangulate positions and we'll be developing an iOS app that dictates the user (blind or disabled) where obstacles are. I'm wondering if this idea is doable and am curious how I can achieve accurate proximity sensing with Bluetooth beacons.</p>		<p>Thank you.</p>	"

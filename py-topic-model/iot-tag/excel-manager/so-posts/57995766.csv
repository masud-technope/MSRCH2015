As far as I'm concerned, the bluetooth sockets I open are strictly reserved to the machine I am in direct connexion with.</p>		<p>An  application on the side of the android/ios device is apparently out of question.</p>		<p>Is this actually possible, and if yes, where should I look?</p>	"

If the device establishes a Bluetooth gateway session with the server, then your app should be able to create a standard TCP/IP or UDP socket and transmit data over it, letting the device's OS route the data over the Bluetooth connection and the server route the data over the Internet. Your app should not care HOW it is connected to the Internet, only that it is. That is the whole point of network routing and transport providers."

The profile exactly does , what is mentioned in your question. If Bluetooth PAN profile is supported in your gateway device, you can complete the task with ease."

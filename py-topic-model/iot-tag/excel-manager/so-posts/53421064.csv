I am trying to use the AWS IoT basicPubSub.py script to test the connection, but getting an error:</p>		<pre><code> ssl.SSLError: unknown error (_ssl.c:3946)	</code></pre>		<p>I have been through all the certificates several times, but want to check/fully understand if I can pull the rootCAFile, certfile and privatekey from the command line utility and/or from the IAM interface? I have download each piece of information and stored in local files. </p>		<pre><code>python basicPubSub.py -e &lt;endpoint&gt; -r &lt;rootCAFilePath&gt; -c &lt;certFilePath&gt; -k &lt;privateKeyFilePath&gt; 	</code></pre>		<p>The main aim is just to ensure everything is correct or I have another problem something else? Is there a way to test each certificate to ensure each file is correct and has the right information?</p>	"

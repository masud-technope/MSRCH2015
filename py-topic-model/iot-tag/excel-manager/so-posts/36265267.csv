I am trying to create a function on Node-Red to query the table and email the results but I can't figure out how to configure SMTP email node for Yahoo. All examples are for Gmail only. Should I use 'nodemailer' node or something else? Any suggestions or examples?	Thank you,	Michael </p>	"

Then I installed node.js and node-red locally, imported nodemailer and that worked from my machine, finally exported nodes from local to Bluemix and it is sending emails now. I am now struggling with email formatting. :)"

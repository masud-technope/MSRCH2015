However there are lots of IOT devices with different communication capabilities, features and applications. </p>		<p>Is it possible to find a database that sorts us the software features and physical capabilities of IOT devices on the market. Then matching those features may generate new scenarios for different IOT ecosystems such as home, medical, energy etc. That feature matching process can be driven by developers or automatically.</p>		<p>Briefly, is there a (or is it possible to find out such a) database and generate new scenarios from its entries which are describing device features and physical capabilities.

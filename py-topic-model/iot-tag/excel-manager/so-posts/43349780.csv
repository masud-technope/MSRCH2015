My question is how can i initiate a connection to the outside and listen for an answer without port forwarding ?</p>		<p>When in the same network (@home) I'm using a simple udp socket on a known port.</p>		<p>Is there a protocol/solution?</p>		<p>What i did for the moment is to use Firebase Cloud Messaging to reach the outside, but of course a smartphone can't answer back to the IoT (Json request at the moment).</p>		<pre><code>IoT --&gt; Cloud --&gt; App	</code></pre>		<p>but not</p>		<pre><code>Iot &lt;-- Cloud &lt;-- App	</code></pre>		<p>Can I solve this by using XMPP requests in FCM?</p>		<p>You have to imagine a daily scenario for an end customer product.</p>	"

The REST API to the Firebase Database works in the same infrastructure, except it uses regular HTTP requests instead of web sockets. But both Web Sockets and HTTP requests go over the regular HTTPS port (443). So unless your Firewall blocks HTTP(S) traffic, this approach should work. </p>		<p>In a scenario like this, you'd use the Firebase Database as the intermediary between the Android app and the IoT devices.</p>	"

I can only do this in the console using the gcloud iot command. </p>		<p>I've have tried clicking through the console, but find it very hard to navigate. Where can I see my registered devices?</p>	"

Strangely the link redirects me to https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/google/cloudiot.googleapis.com?returnUrl=%2Fiot%2Fregistries where i can select a project, but nowhere do i see a button CREATE REGISTRY."

That may hide the button?"

If i do not do it in that order, I will not be navigating to the right menu screen. A direct link that includes the project has the following form:</p>		<p><a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/iot/registries?folder=&amp;organizationId=&amp;project=" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://console.cloud.google.com/iot/registries?folder=&amp;organizationId=&amp;project=</a>{project-id}</p>	"

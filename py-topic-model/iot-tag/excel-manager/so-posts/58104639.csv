The first step I closed the GPIO by calling of the method close() and after that, I tried to open it again, but PeripheralManager throws exception android.os.ServiceSpecificException: BCM17 is already in use (code 16). Why does there happen?</p>		<p>Snippet of the code for example:</p>		<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>Gpio gpio = PeripheralManager.getInstance().openGpio("BCM17");	.	.	// do some interactions with opened GPIO	.	.	gpio.close();		Gpio gpio1 = PeripheralManager.getInstance().openGpio("BCM17"); //throws exception android.os.ServiceSpecificException: BCM17 is already in use (code 16)	</code></pre>	"

I thought that the method `Gpio#close()` releases GPIO port and there is possible to use it in the scope of the same application without device/app reloading. Cause it isn't clear description of the method `close()` that says "This must be called in order for the GPIO pin to be released and be available to other users.", what does it mean "available to other users", is it available to other application or available to use in scope of run application?"

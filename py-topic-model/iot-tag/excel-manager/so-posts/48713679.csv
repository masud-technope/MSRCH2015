I'm using the same "quickstart" instructions to test, by setting up "my-registry" and "my-device". Let's call them projects A and B. I then run both the python and node examples pulled straight from git. The node example runs fine for both projects A and B, validated by pulling using gcloud. However, the python example works for project A, but with project b gets a "on disconnect. 1. out of memory" error. There is never a "connection accepted" message for B, but yes for A. "Out of memory" seems to be a generic error, not really the issue. It could represent a variety of issues in connectivity. Nothing on the server side Anyone encountered this one before? I appreciate any help in resolving or at least trace the eror.</p>	"

I ended trying on many different devices/os to slowly isolate the issue. Looks like newly created projects rely on newer versions of google cloud sdk and python. Must have python 2.7.14.</p>	"

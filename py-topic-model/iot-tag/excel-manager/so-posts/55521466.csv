At first, I was using <em>msp430-gcc-4.7</em> and getting the error: <strong>.text' will not fit in region rom'</strong>. Then, according to <a href="https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/issues/1968" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> discussion, I upgraded to <strong>msp430-gcc-4.7.3</strong> by following their instruction from the github repo.</p>		<p>Now, I can find <strong>msp430-gcc</strong> from my terminal but whenever I try to create a sky moto I get an error: "<strong>make: msp430-gcc: Command not found"</strong>.</p>		<p>Note: I added <strong>&lt; msp430-gcc>/bin</strong> folder in my PATH variable.<br>	Can anyone please help?</p>		<p>Thanks.</p>	"

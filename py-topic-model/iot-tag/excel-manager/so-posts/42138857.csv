I am discovering different case study for writing a paper with the different situation with the different case study. For example, for Air condition, wheelchair, refrigerator remote operation can be performed well with AMQP for reason. Everywhere on the internet I find very high-level protocol overview but not any example solution."

An AMQP server should be able to run on a RPi with little problem. NOTE: this does NOT mean that is the best solution, among all the IoT protocols, you should choose the one that best focus your application."

But if I want to use AMQP from a ``Rasberry pi`` or from a ``Arduino`` device what will be killer factor for AMQP protocol for these constrained device"

I don't see why this cant be made it a NuGet package that can be called from a PCL. You can even look into building a <a href="http://log.paulbetts.org/the-bait-and-switch-pcl-trick/" rel="nofollow">Bait and Switch package</a> to support your specific scenario.</p>		<p>The code for the IOT client is available <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/tree/master/csharp/device/Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client" rel="nofollow">here</a> under the MIT license and you can repackage this to work for your scenario so that it can be called from a PCL.</p>	"

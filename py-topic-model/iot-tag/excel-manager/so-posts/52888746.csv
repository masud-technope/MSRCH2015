You could simply write your own or use a library like <a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Polly.Net</a></p>		<p>In a distributed world connectivity issues should be expected, so I don't think there is any problem with your code other than is should be more resilient. I think it is really nice that the exceptions even tells you it should be retried, most of the times you have to figure that out yourself. </p>		<p>Some more guidance from the Azure team can be found <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/category/resiliency" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. In your case the Retry pattern is a good fit:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>Retry</p>	  	  <p>Enable an application to handle anticipated, temporary failures when it tries to connect to a service or network resource by transparently retrying an operation that's previously failed.</p>	</blockquote>	"

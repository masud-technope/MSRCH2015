What you're experiencing is likely an issue with the server not allowing http requests because it runs https protocol. </p>		<p>If you google your error you'll see that the error that is thrown an nginx 400 error.</p>	"

Though it seems like, in nodemcu 2.0.0 build, even after adding ssl support, it is not working. Though I get the answer to my query.

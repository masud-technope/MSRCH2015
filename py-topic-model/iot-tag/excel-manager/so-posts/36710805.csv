A mobile phone connects to this AP and then the device starts sending sensor data to the mobile phone. A mobile application plots and displays this data.</p>		<p>Now, i want to send this data from mobile to internet. Connecting my mobile to another AP with internet is not an option, as i don't want to break the continuous data transmission.</p>		<p>Using internet of data provider is one option, but that brings constraint of have mobile data.</p>		<p>What other options do i have to send my data from mobile to internet ??</p>		<p><strong><em>Edit:-</em></strong></p>		<p>I worked on the suggestions, and came to this point:-</p>		<p>1) WiFi-IoT device (in station mode) and mobile phone connect to same Internet-enabled WiFi access point. WiFi-IoT device has the IP address of the mobile phone for current network, and sends data to a TCP port (eg. 9801) of this IP address. The application in mobile phone reads the data from the port no. 9801 and stores it and hosts it on the internet.</p>		<p>This works fine.</p>		<p>2)WiFi-IoT device comes up in Access Point mode, and the mobile phone connects to this Access Point. Now there is one-to-one connection between WiFi-IoT device and mobile phone.</p>		<p>My question is, in the second scenario, without breaking this one-to-one connection, is there way to host data to internet:-</p>		<p>1) without using mobile internet provided by mobile data service provider ?</p>		<p>2) without using a second mobile phone ?</p>		<p>I may be wrong, but i am just asking this to make be sure whether my requirement can be achieved or not !!</p>	"

Then make the server send a data copy back to your phone.  It's  two step process: 1) while the IoT device is in AP mode, use your phone to login and configure which Internet-connected AP it should be connected to. This serves as UI for your IoT device.  2) start sending data. </p>		<p>Or a bit ugly, just let the IoT device talk to your phone in the same WiFi network via private IP.</p>		<p>I brought up this way because you mentioned anyway your device has to send data to Internet(I assume it's a server) and have phone talk to a known location server is more portable and scalable once you have more than one IoT device. </p>		<p>--Further Edit--	I don't think there is a way to do what you described. At least from my experience:</p>		<p>1) on the link layer, the wireless NIC has to be able to connect to two APs at the same time. This is not a feature currently available.	2) on the network layer, there has to be two IP address attached to the same NIC, which I don't think is available in current OS for wireless NICs. Though there is a way to do this for Ethernet card, I.e. via Aliasing. </p>	"

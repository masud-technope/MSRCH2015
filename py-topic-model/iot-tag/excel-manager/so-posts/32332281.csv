At first I've created a unique table with hash: device id and range: ISO 8601 date format. I'm now able to display a 24h d3 chart of this data (per device) though I'd like to increase granularity of my chart allowing me to display 1 week, 1 month and even 1 year data. Processing all the data on each access is impractical so the idea it's to create other tables for this data. Like 1 hour, 1 day and 1 month averages data. Actualizing the data simultaneous in all tables would made it expensive. What approach would you guys suggested me for this application? I'm trying to implement it server-less so my last option would be a cron service.</p>	"

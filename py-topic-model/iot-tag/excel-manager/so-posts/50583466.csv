Interact with IoT devices is the easiest part for me. What I'm struggling is the first 2 items. For this I was thinking to use a cloud platform like AWS(<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/),Azure" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://aws.amazon.com/),Azure</a> IOT(azure.microsoft.com) or WATSON IBM(<a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.ibm.com/watson/</a>). Reading the docs of them I could not see how to perform the first task or how to register a new device via a mobile app. Any comments are more than welcome.</p>		<p>Also I was thinking building a database on a server that will manage the users, and sending/receiving messages from the IoT device/app as this app that I'm trying to build is not so data hungry(reading temperature and interacting with 2 relays)</p>		<p>P.S. I know about Blynk.io but the prices/conditions that they are offering is exceeding my budget.</p>	"

The registry allows you to keep a record of all of the devices that are connected to your AWS IoT account.</p>		<p>The fastest way to start using your AWS IoT Button is to download the mobile app for iOS or Android. The mobile app creates the required AWS IoT resources for you, and adds an event source to your button that uses a Lambda blueprint to invoke a new AWS Lambda function of your choice. Blueprints are preconfigured Lambda functions that allow you to quickly connect the click of a button to the functions that fit you best, such as sending automated emails or text messages or deploying other AWS services. You can download the mobile apps from The Apple App Store or Google Play. </p>		<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/register-device.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/register-device.html</a></p>		<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/cognito-identities.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/cognito-identities.html</a></p>	"

I decided to use it and searched for developed projects. I found one decent <a href="http://wso2.com/library/articles/2014/09/demonstration-on-architecture-of-internet-of-things-an-analysis/" rel="nofollow">project</a>!</p>		<p>This project uses MQTT as communication protocol, Raspberry Pi&lt;->Message Broker, and Message Broker&lt;->Complex Event Manager.</p>		<p>My questions are the following: </p>		<blockquote>	  <p>1) Does the current version of the WSO2 Message Broker (v2.2.0) already support MQTT? Because I can't find documentation of this version supporting MQTT.</p>	  	  <p>2) According to some references the WSO2 Message Broker v3.x.x will support MQTT, is that correct and when will this version be released?</p>	  	  <p>3) Are there any other possibilities to use the WSO2 platform components in combination with the MQTT protocol?</p>	  	  <p>4) Are there any other documented Internet of Things projects that use the WSO2 platform?</p>	</blockquote>	"

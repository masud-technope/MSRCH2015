Is there a way to get the exact time? It seems like calling a server is not the solution.</p>		<p>I have full access to the wifi network that the users will be connected to, and will also be able to e.g. set up a ble transmitter.</p>		<p>Does anyone have any insights or have worked with a similar project?</p>	"

I believe matching the _exact_ international atomic-time to the microsecond is not that important. What you want is a reference 'beep' from the server, that all devices will receive at the same time. What I would do is just use [socket.io](http://socket.io/) and `socket.emit('beep')` to all clients. But even with this, they won't receive it _EXACTLY_ at the very same femtosecond, because you will always have network lag, slower device, etc."

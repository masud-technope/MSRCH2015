I am still completely new to this field. </p>		<p>Let's assume we have a normal Amazon Echo Dot or a camera and I would want to investigate it so I can get audio data out of the RAM. </p>		<p>Does anybody know for how long data like this stays in the RAM of an IoT device, maybe like a standard time frame ? This does not have to be Amazon Echo Dot, the question would work with any iot device. </p>	"

Generally the most accurate answer would be slightly longer than the data is required to be retained for retrieval and processing purposes or until the device is switched off.</p>	"

The GUI of the application worked fine, however the garage door didn't respond and I could see the zWave USB light flickering heavily.</p>		<p>The next morning I saw in the logs that the switch was turned on and off multiple times at night in a period of a couple seconds. It seems it kept the actions in a queue and executed them when the device was responsive again.</p>		<p>So here's my question: Can I turn this queue off? I don't like my garage door opening and closing at the middle of the night.</p>	"

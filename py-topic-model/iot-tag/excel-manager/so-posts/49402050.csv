The rule triggers the lambda.</p>		<p>Currently my iot rule is something like this:</p>		<p><code>SELECT * FROM '$aws/things/testThing/shadow/update/accepted'</code></p>		<p>But instead of 'testThing' i want to use something like </p>		<p><code>SELECT * FROM '$aws/things/#/shadow/update/accepted'</code></p>		<p>which will trigger the same lambda for any thing shadow update.</p>		<p>But I am unable to come up with such a rule. Currently I am creating multiple rules(one for each shadow) which I don't think is the right thing to do.</p>		<p>I might use something like </p>		<p><code>SELECT * FROM '$aws/things/#'</code></p>		<p>which will give lot of unwanted data and unwanted triggers, I am trying to avoid doing such a thing.</p>	"

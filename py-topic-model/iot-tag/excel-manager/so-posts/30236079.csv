It has dht22 temp and humidity sensor connected to it and running. </p>		<p><strong>Question:</strong> While building Internet of things starter app , do i need to code anything on Rpi to push that sensor data into Bluemix or simply providing the MAC address and the API will do the trick?</p>		<p><strong>Note:</strong> I followed a recipe to configure my Raspberry Pi , registered with the MAC address. It is connected and sending messages when i check in the device.</p>		<p>Kindly let me know if i need to do any other configuration or coding   to send specifically my dht22 sensor data to visualize in Bluemix and use it in Node-red.</p>	"

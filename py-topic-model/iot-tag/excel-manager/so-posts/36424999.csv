I have follow all the step mention by microsoft <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-protocol-gateway" rel="nofollow">Deploying Cloud Sample</a>	.But I am doing same deployment process using power shell.But deployment process failed at last stage.<a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8TMns.png" rel="nofollow">Please check image for more details on power shell command</a>. </p>		<p>Thanks in advance.</p>	"

An Azure IoT Hub instance "speaks" MQTT natively.</p>	"

But in actual scenario I will use this gateway to implement node-comm protocol that will used by my legacy device which only communication through nodecomm."

In this case, it's because the last arguments are not formatted properly. Take your third attempt on this last screenshot, and remove the square brackets '[' and ']' around the subscription and vmcount arguments"
36424999,60525570,36437936,3,0,Wed Apr 06 16:08:00 EDT 2016,6051924,"understood, that sounds like a good scenario. I'm positive the problem is with how the script is invoked from the command line: quotes around the password section (Before HostName and after the shared access key last character) and also I don't think you should have brackets the subscription and vmcount arguments. Feel free to post a copy/pasted log of the error here if you'd like, just edit out the keys first (you left some in your first screenshot, you should change them)"

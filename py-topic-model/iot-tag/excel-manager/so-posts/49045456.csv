You will still, however, need to put each RadBeacon Dot into configuration mode one by one and wait for your custom configuration app to connect via bluetooth and configure the beacon.  Since bluetooth connections can be a bit finicky, this might take 5 secs or more with retries.  So best case scenario, you're  talking 5 secs x 700 = one hour to get them all configured.  </p>		<p>You'll also have to account for the time it takes you to write the config app and debug it until it is working reliably and as quickly as possible. I have lots of experience with these kinds of apps, and would expect it to take me at least 8 hours, probably much more.  So the best case level of effort to get all beacons configured is 9 hours.</p>		<p>The alternative, of course, is to train an intern (or your little sister) to do this manually, and pay him or her for the trouble.  If you can get all these manual steps done in 45 seconds, doing 700 of them will take a little less than 9 hours -- faster!</p>	"

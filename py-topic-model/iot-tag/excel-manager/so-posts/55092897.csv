I added a knob to control the input and meter as an output. When I change the knob, let's say, to 5 for example, the meter also changes to 5.	Now the machine code is actually made, and it gives an array for the results of tests, and I want to send that array to Firebase.</p>		<p>How can I accomplish this?</p>	"

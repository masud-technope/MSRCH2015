But suddenly it started printing a single constant reading each time the application is 	restarted. Whatever temperature value is first read at application startup is repeated throughout the application runtime. I used the tempo utility app to verify that the 	sensor is actually reporting the correct realtime values.</p>		<p>I tried re-installing the OS (Ubuntu 18.04.1), tried multple version of bluez ( 5.48 which is pre-installed,5.39 and 5.37) but the issue is still there.</p>		<p>I also changed the advertisement frequency in the bluemaestro device.</p>		<p>How to resolve this ?</p>	"

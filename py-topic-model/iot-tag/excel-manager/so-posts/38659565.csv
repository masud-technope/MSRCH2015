I am trying to establish communication with 3rd party server from Amazon IoT by publishing messages by the MQTT client in Amazon IoT to the 3rd party server. I examined the options available in settings of Amazon IoT and also studied about Rules engine. The settings have no option to send messages to the 3rd party hosts and also the rules engine are used to communicate with only other Amazon services. How to publish messages from Amazon IoT to 3rd party server?</p>	"

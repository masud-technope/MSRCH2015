I know how to register devices with deivce Id,token and authentication manually. but I just like to know that is there any other easy way around to do it. It would be great If I got some one shed light on this from scratch. Thanks in advance.</p>	"

There is an API called "Add device" that, when called, will register a new device instance of a specific device type against your IoT Foundation instance.</p>		<p>I could imagine a new device that knows it is not registered executing a self registration request to define itself as a new device type.  What I would next suggest is that you read the links above and see if they make sense.  If they answer your question fully, great.  If not, simply post a new question that is specifically targeted at a specific areas and we'll be watching this set of tags and respond back as quickly as we can.</p>	"

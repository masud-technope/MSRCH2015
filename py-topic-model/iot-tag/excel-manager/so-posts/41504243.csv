Then, I tried to change the server to another one, just to test, and then I get the same error 3821. My AT commands list is:</p>		<pre><code>AT+CGATT=1	AT+QIFGCNT=0	AT+QICSGP=1,"zap.vivo.com.br"	AT+QIACT	AT+QILOCIP   (IP OK!)		AT+QHTTPURL=38,30	   CONNECT	      http://www.posttestserver.com/post.php	   OK		AT+QHTTPPOST=10,50,80	   CONNECT	      helloworld	   OK	      +CME ERROR: 3821	</code></pre>		<p>Does anyone know what is wrong?</p>	"

In the source file of "ril_http.c" of Quectel modules, add delay of minimum 10ms in HTTP call back handler. it will solve the timeout error and will able to post it successfully.</p>	"

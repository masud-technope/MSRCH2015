Need Code or Helping material or Link. I don't want to send it by using any Wifi module to Arduino just by using Ethernet Cable.</p>	"

(And I think really only one) </p>		<p>For both, you will need to write Arduino code that can talk to an external server.</p>		<p>You can find info on that <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/EthernetServer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>		<p>Next, you will need to decide if you want to send it directly to a SQL Server, or if you want to send it to a RESTful Web API, and have that API write the data to SQL Server. </p>		<p>The first option will require you to write your own implementation for TDS over TCP. TDS is the protocol SQL Server uses to send and recieve database queries. </p>		<p>You can find info on SQL Server and the TDS protocol <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd304523.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>		<p>This option will be a lot of work, and I am not sure that you will have enough room on the arduino to fit all of the code that would be required for even just a dirty, minimal implementation. Nevermind a reliable, quick, and safe one.</p>		<p>Your other option would be to implement a way to send HTTP Requests over TCP using the arduino. This would allow you to talk to a Web-based REST API. The API would act as a middle man, taking HTTP GET or POST Requests from the arduino, and translating them to SQL Server by means of some database driver. </p>		<p>As far as implementing HTTP with the arduino, you can do that with precreated libaries, like <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/WebClient" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a></p>		<p>As far as what you would use for an API, that can be any Server Side programming	language. I personally recomend using ASP.NET to create the API, and ADO.NET to talk to the database. There is lots of documentation all over the net on both of these subjects. A good place to start would be <a href="https://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for a Web API and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/ado-net-overview" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for information on ADO.NET</p>	"

It was tested on Arduino Nano and Arduino Mega. Although very obsolete, this might give you an idea how to implement it if you choose to do so. </p>		<p><a href="https://github.com/mustafakemalgilor/arduino-mssql" rel="nofollow noreferrer">arduino-mssql on Github</a></p>	"

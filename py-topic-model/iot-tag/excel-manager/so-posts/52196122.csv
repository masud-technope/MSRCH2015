I've already integrated Chirp into both the device and the Android app, but I need a solution which would allow me to send a bigger payload (Chirp allows for a payload of only 8 bytes in their ultrasonic frequency profile), and also a solution with a smaller error rate. </p>		<p>I know Bluetooth 4.1 allows for a BLE payload of 27 bytes and that it has a Bit Error Rate of 0.1% for a Packet Error Rate of 30.8% (Bluetooth Sig Spec calls for testing sensitivity at this rate). I've been searching all over the web but could not find an answer for the error rate for  ultrasonic Chirp transmissions.</p>		<p>Can I get a brief description of the main differences between BLE and Chirp and the error rates of each, so that I can take an educated approach to the solution.</p>		<p>Thanks in advance!</p>	"

In addition, Bluetooth itself themes to have much higher data speed. 27 bytes is the max packet size for BT 4.0, but the total speed is up to 1 Mbit/s, and the distance is up to 100m, which should be much faster/longer then any sound channels."

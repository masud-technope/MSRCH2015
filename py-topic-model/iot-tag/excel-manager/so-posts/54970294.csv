I've connected a relay on the GPIO pins and I rewired the power button from the mainboard of the computer, to run through the relay.</p>		<p>The web interface runs using php. So, just a basic example of a script, running in php that makes the relay do a click looks like this:</p>		<pre><code>shell_exec('/usr/local/bin/gpio -g mode 17 out');	shell_exec('/usr/local/bin/gpio -g write 17 1');	usleep(500000);	shell_exec('/usr/local/bin/gpio -g write 17 0');	</code></pre>		<p>The script sets pin 17 for output, then turns on the voltage on the pin, waits half a second then turns off the voltage. The relay is connected to ground and pin 17 on the GPIO, of course.</p>		<p>Keep in mind that this is a very basic example of using GPIO from php, without any libraries.</p>	"

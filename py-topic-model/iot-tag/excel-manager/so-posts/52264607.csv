Also not sure if the APIs are communicating through the Messaging infrastructure by adopting MQTT or CoAP.</p>		<p>With respect to AWS IoT Platform you can resort to something like a Simulator infrastructure along with Lambda to achieve your goals to certain extent. Check the article on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/device-simulation-with-aws-iot-and-aws-lambda/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Device Simulation with AWS IoT and AWS Lambda</a>. Which could help you. </p>		<p>With respect to performance of API which would deal with your devices you might need to understand the following factors:</p>		<ul>	<li>Bandwidth</li>	<li>Latency</li>	<li>Scale</li>	<li>Volume of Devices</li>	<li>Data/Message size</li>	<li>Protocol you're adopting</li>	</ul>	"

The issue that i am facing right now is that the timestamp bunch the date and the time together and it poses problems when i try to create certain data visualizations in any data analytics and visualization software. I will make things easier for me splitting the date and time from the timestamp. I am aware that the data is in json format.</p>		<p>In addition, I am using node-red, do let me know if the formatting of data should be done at node red.</p>		<p>Here is my sample sensor data :</p>		<pre><code>{	   "_id": "04691370-387e-11e8-8cd5-8b3f61628d0d",	   "_rev": "1-a4328ecd41d03b8e4ac86de06baf03d2",	   "deviceType": "RaspberryPi",	   "deviceId": "9074bd",	   "eventType": "event",	   "format": "json",	   "timestamp": "2018-04-05T11:04:12.583+08:00",	   "data": {	     "d": {	       "temperature": 19.5,	       "humidity": 44,	       "heatIndex": 18.65	     }	   }	 }	</code></pre>		<p>Things that I am using:</p>		<ul>	<li>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B </li>	<li>Raspbian for Robots (Dexter Industries) </li>	<li>GrovePi+  </li>	<li>GrovePi DHT 11, Light sensor , Sound sensor , UV sensor</li>	<li>Node Red with all the grovepi+ nodes including nodes for IBM Watson </li>	<li>IBM Watson , IBM Waston Iot </li>	<li>Cloudant NoSQL DB</li>	<li>CData ODBC Driver for Cloudant </li>	<li>Microsoft Power Bi (subject to change , depends on which software is easier to Adopt)</li>	</ul>	"

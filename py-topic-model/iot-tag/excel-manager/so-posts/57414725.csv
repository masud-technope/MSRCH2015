Since we can <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pt/blogs/iot/how-to-bridge-mosquitto-mqtt-broker-to-aws-iot/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bridge local mosquitto to AWS IoT</a>, I suppose that this last one should accept the max size of payload from mosquitto <a href="http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mqtt-protocol-messages-overview/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">witch is 256Mb</a>. So what is the max size (in terms of payload) that I can send to a broker in AWS-IotCore?</p>		<p>The reason for that question is that I dont want to create to many documents in my mongoDb. For that I am going to send hourly data and the document or the message payload will be much higher than sends for seconds. </p>	"

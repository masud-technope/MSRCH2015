It has an ethernet port and webserver. </p>		<p>You can go to different urls such as <strong>127.0.0.1/setget?%sen-3</strong>	and it outputs:</p>		<pre><code>handler.setget(%sen-3)	500	</code></pre>		<p>where 500 would be the current room co2 concentration in ppm. Can someone point me in the direction to go about scraping this into a database and charting it to see trends in co2. Ex: how much does co2 rise while sleeping, how much does it change with occupancy, etc. I was thinking Google Sheets and Google Charts would be a good start. How can I scrape this page and store it in Google Sheets? Python? I only have experience with HTML, PHP but don't mind learning python if it isn't too complicated of a project. </p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

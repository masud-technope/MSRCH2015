I've task connecting (REST) to my IOT-device through Internet. For that I want use DO droplet with real IP(for sample 178.62.209.11) and setup OpenVPN on it. For my home LAN I've buy the Mikrotik Router RB951Ui-2HnD which must allow setup the OpenVPN client. So, my LAN with DO Droplet must be VPN. </p>		<p>And now my question is how to do traffic translation from MY SERVER 178.62.209.11 to LOCAL device IOT 192.168.1.11? I understand that my server have only one IP, but I look that may be port forwording! For sample, if I want send request to my IOT device by 80 port, then I can use for that port forwards, like 178.62.209.11:1234 &lt;=> 192.168.1.11:80, and for second IOT device 178.62.209.11:1235 &lt;=> 192.168.1.15:80, and etc.</p>		<p>I found how to set OpenVPN to DO Droplet, I found how adjust OpenVPN client on the router, but can not found how get simple access to my device. Can you help?</p>	"

If you have working OpenVPN tunnel already you need: 1. make port forwarding in your droplet 2. route to 192.168.1.0/24 through mikrotik tunnel IP so after forwarding traffic will go to mikrotik inside tunnel; 3. on mikrotik side route to IP of droplet tunnel side so answer from device goes back into tunnel."

I can open up the IOT web server on the pi and start the app from there and it runs correctly, but then I am unable to debug.</p>		<p>I have also tried using different authentication modes but they each have their own problems. </p>		<p>Windows authentication yields:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>WindowsAppDeployer::Unable to connect to the Microsoft Visual Studio	  Remote Debugger named '192.168.1.42'.

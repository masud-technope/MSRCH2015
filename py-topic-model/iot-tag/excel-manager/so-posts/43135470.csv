I am using the following snippet</p>		<p><strong>Snippet</strong>:</p>		<pre><code>private double getDistance(int rssi, int txPower) 	{	 return Math.pow(10d, ((double) txPower - rssi) / (10 * 2));	}	</code></pre>		<p>For rssi i am using the device's RSSI but for txpower by default i am using "1". The return i am getting is similar to "464.2345" in long. so now my question is,</p>		<p><strong>1.What should be given as input in txpower and how?</strong></p>		<p><strong>2.How to convert the return values to meters?</strong></p>		<p>Thanks in advance.</p>	"

43135470,73348529,43135470,3,0,Fri Mar 31 08:04:00 EDT 2017,6207636,"Okay is there any other way to get distance? @AlexanderFarber"
43135470,73348687,43135470,3,0,Fri Mar 31 08:08:00 EDT 2017,5082285,"No comment on the formula (something like the inverse square law could be used) but basically the approach is right. The ratio RSSI/TxPower is proportional to the distance. But the TxPower should be a calibrated value stored on the beacon and you should read it from the beacon's advertisement data when scanning it. Is it an iBeacon, Eddystone beacon, AltBeacon or something else?"
43135470,73350155,43135470,3,0,Fri Mar 31 08:56:00 EDT 2017,5082285,"I'm not familiar with that device, it apparently doesn't follow any Bluetooth beacon standard and it might not have any calibrated TxPower value available. In actual Bluetooth beacons the TxPower is the measured signal strength (like RSSI) at 1 meter distance. You can measure the device's RSSI at 1 meter (use the average of several measurements) and use that as the TxPower value. Then you have a calibrated reference value."

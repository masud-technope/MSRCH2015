I tried both but only the senseHat manages to register.	<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vLB7R.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Watson IoT Devices</a>	Then when connecting my raspberryPi as a gateway in Node-red it keep on failing with message:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>15/12/2016 Ã  11:25:21msg : string [49]IBMIoT: Error: Connection	  refused: Not authorized	  I created an IoT node in my Raspberry node-red:	  <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Pgbl.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">gateway node</a></p>	</blockquote>		<p>So what is the correct way to connect the senseHat onto my raspberry pi as a device and raspberry pi as gateway both in watson iot platform?</p>	"

Remove any node in node-red using the device or gateway	2. Used the senHat device in :</p>		<pre><code>/etc/iotsample-raspberrypi/device.cfg	</code></pre>		<p>3. stoped iot and nodered:</p>		<pre><code>sudo service iot stop	node-red-stop	</code></pre>		<ol start="4">	<li>started both iot and nodered</li>	<li>added the nodes in nodered </li>	</ol>	"

Sounds dumb, but if you are copying your credentials (I did so when following the online tutorial), it might introduce a space character before them in node-red. It was so small I didn't realize after a while, but it was keeping me from logging in.</p>	"

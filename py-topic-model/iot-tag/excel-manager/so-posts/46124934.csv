Running</p>		<pre><code>sudo ./flash-all.sh 	</code></pre>		<p>I got this in my logs:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>./flash-all.sh: line 52: ./u-boot.imx: Permission denied</p>	</blockquote>		<p>If I change permissons</p>		<pre><code>chmod 777 u-boot.imx	</code></pre>		<p>I got </p>		<blockquote>	  <p>./flash-all.sh: line 52: ./u-boot.imx: cannot execute binary file:	  Exec format error</p>	</blockquote>		<p>I already solved several other issues which werent described in tutorial, including</p>		<ol>	<li>I have to run script as sudo, otherwise I got</li>	</ol>		<blockquote>	  <p>&lt; waiting for any device ></p>	</blockquote>		<ol start="2">	<li>I had to rewrite fastboot command to $(which fastboot) inside flash-all.sh (same with flash and bootloader), otherwise commands are unknown even thought I added them to PATH</li>	</ol>		<p>I am using </p>		<ul>	<li>ubuntu 16.14,</li>	<li>android studio with installed sdk 26</li>	<li>Pico Pro Maker Kit with Pico i.MX7 Dual Development Board</li>	</ul>		<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>	"

This might be why you can run <code>which fastboot</code> successfully (which would indicate it's in your PATH), but the script cannot see this.</p>	"

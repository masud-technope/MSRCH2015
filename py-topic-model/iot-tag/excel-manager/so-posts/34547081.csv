I am trying to learn the ropes of AWS IOT.</p>		<p>I understand that I can use a client like MQTT.fx to publish messages to a topic in a message broker</p>		<p>I also see that AWS IOT resources console, I can create things, attach certificates, policies, and create rules.</p>		<p>If I create a thing say 'car' using the IOT resources console, is there some way that the console gives where i can have the car publish MQTT messages to a topic?  Or is the only way wiring up the simulate car to an actual device using the SDK.</p>		<p>Like I mentioned, I am aware of publishing through an MQTT client.  I just want to understand how to make a 'thing' I created in the resources console, to publish the MQTT messages to a message broker?</p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

This is described in <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/verify-pub-sub.html" rel="nofollow">Verify MQTT Subscribe and Publish</a> section of Developers Guide. Using AWS CLI:</p>		<pre><code>aws iot describe-endpoint	</code></pre>		<p>It will return something like that:</p>		<pre><code>{	    "endpointAddress": "ABCDEF12345678.iot.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com"	}	</code></pre>		<p>Your thing should use one of existing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/sdk/" rel="nofollow">AWS IoT SDKs</a> to subscribe to MQTT topic and start publishing some data ie. speed, fuel consumption, etc.</p>		<p>In general you can simulate your thing (ie. car) by subscribing to some topic:</p>		<pre><code>mosquitto_sub --cafile "path-to-cert\rootCA.pem" --cert "path-to-cert\cert.pem" \	--key "path-to-cert\privateKey.pem" \	-h "ABCDEF12345678.iot.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com" -p 8883 -q 1 -d -t "topic/test" \	-i "car1"	</code></pre>		<p>Then in other terminal you can publish:</p>		<pre><code>mosquitto_pub --cafile rootCA.pem --cert certs\cert.pem --key privateKey.pem \	-h "ABCDEF12345678.iot.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com" -p 8883 -q 1 -d -t topic/test 	-i car2 -m "Hello, World"	</code></pre>	"

I have a simple url that i want to hit without opening the browser in mobile phones. I am clicking a button and that url needs to get hit, without the browser getting opened. I am not concerned with what is on that page i just want to load it. I basically need it for my arduino cum ethernet shield IOT project, wherein i am controlling my appliances with my android phone. </p>		<p>Here is a snippet of what i am doing. The apk is generating without errors but the url is not getting hit somehow. </p>		<p>Thankyou </p>		<pre><code>public void led1on(View view){	      try {	        URL u = new URL("http://172.17.27.173/?2");	        HttpURLConnection http = (HttpURLConnection) u.openConnection();	        http.connect();	    }catch (Exception e){	        e.getMessage();	        e.printStackTrace();	    }	}	</code></pre>	"

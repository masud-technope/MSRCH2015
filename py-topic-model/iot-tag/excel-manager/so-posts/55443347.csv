I am reading papers, googling etc in order to understand what is syntactic and what is semantic interoperability in IoT, and what is the difference between them, but I am really confused, either beacause my background is too poor on this field or I cannot understand the small (?) boundary between those 2 words. Can you help with an example, or anything that could help me?</p>		<p>Thank you...</p>	"

This part of the standard does not care if you transfer temperature data, smart meter data, parking sensors data or whatever. </p>		<p>The semantical standard defines how e.g. a temperature sensor is represented. See <a href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LWM2M Registry</a> under ID 3303 for details. You can find on that page semantic standards for different domains. </p>		<p>Another view to syntactical standard vs. semantical standard: JSON defines a syntactical standard, while a specific JSON Schema file defining the JSON for a temperature sensor would provide a semantic standard.</p>	"

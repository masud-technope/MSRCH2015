It looks like your error is with the registered connection.  Did the quickstart work ok for you?"
37042880,61667776,37042880,3,0,Thu May 05 21:15:00 EDT 2016,1519023,"I received the same unsuccessfully sent for both QuickStart and registered connection."

37042880,61668193,37042880,3,0,Thu May 05 21:32:00 EDT 2016,1519023,"Is there an example of the expected Json formatting?"

I will comment there now."

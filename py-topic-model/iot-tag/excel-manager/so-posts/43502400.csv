I currently use the package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-paho-mqtt" rel="noreferrer">react-native-paho-mqtt</a> to connect my app. Here is my code : </p>		<pre><code>function getClient(onConnect, onConnectionFailed, onConnectionLost, 	  onMessageArrived) {	  logger.trace('getClient()');	  const clientID = uuidV4();	  // Create a client instance	  const client = new Paho.MQTT.Client(signedUrl, clientID);  // eslint-disable-line no-undef		  // set callback handlers	  client.onConnectionLost = onConnectionLost;	  client.onMessageArrived = onMessageArrived;		  // connect the client	  client.connect({	    keepAliveInterval: 15,	    onSuccess: onConnect,	    onFailure: onConnectionFailed,	  });		  return client;	}	</code></pre>		<p>5 minute after my main connection, I get an error when I try to connect an other client. I get this error: <code>AMQJS0007E Socket error:{0}.</code>. I do not have any more information about the error. </p>		<p>Does anyone know what is happening or how to solve this problem ? </p>	"

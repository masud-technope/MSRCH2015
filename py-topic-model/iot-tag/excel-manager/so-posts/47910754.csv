In more details, here's what I want to do :</p>		<ol>	<li>Have an HTTP Server running on an embedded iot device that is able to send array of bytes representing an image. </li>	<li>Embedded this custom video source into the "video" tag as the video source. </li>	<li>Be able to use "start/stop/pause" features like any video but have my custom source handle the underlying HTTP requests.</li>	</ol>		<p>Is there any "easy" way to achieve this ? </p>		<p>My idea was to create a custom Javascript object that I would pass to the video element as the video source Object that would handle those actions. </p>		<p>I'd like to have some suggestions.</p>		<p>Thanks,</p>	"

But maybe another idea is send the bytes and draw the video yourself using the canvas element.  You could even implement some rudimentary compression like RLE.. etc."

I need to be able to "stream" images at a reasonable frame rate ( ideally 30 fps) over a LAN. (Images are mono 8bpp 640x480). Would WebSocket or WebRTC be the way to go instead ? (sorry for the delay of response --> holidays)"

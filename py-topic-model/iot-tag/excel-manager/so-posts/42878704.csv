Should I put   something like sudo sed -i -e \$amsg.payload /etc/FILE_NAME.txt  OR sudo sed -i -e \$a{msg.payload} /etc/FILE_NAME.txt. I tried both. it didn't work. When I write something like that, I can see that FILE_NAME.txt contains either {msg.payload} or msg.payload depending what I have written."

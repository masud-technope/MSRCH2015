This may update or install other applications (sideloaded) without requiring any user input, however, when a new application is installed I need to configure it as startup, so if the device is restarted I know for sure the process is running.</p>		<p>Also, more than one app will need to be configured to launch at startup.</p>		<p>I've tried the following methods:</p>		<p>1)The startup task extension, doesn't work on Win10 IoT Core, only being available on Win Desktop:	<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.startuptask#windows-web-app-wwa-startup-task-extension" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.startuptask#windows-web-app-wwa-startup-task-extension</a></p>		<p>2)Configuring as startup on first run doesn't work either, and an exception is thrown when querying by the startup id.	<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/08/01/configure-app-start-log/#17JjiMyXTtyyAkRV.97" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/08/01/configure-app-start-log/#17JjiMyXTtyyAkRV.97</a></p>		<p>3) Running powershell scripts or IotStartup commands from the 'auto-update' process after a new app is installed, however on Win10IoT Core this cannot be executed from the application (at least for powershell).	<a href="https://www.hackster.io/AnuragVasanwala/windows-10-iot-core-setting-startup-app-887ed0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.hackster.io/AnuragVasanwala/windows-10-iot-core-setting-startup-app-887ed0</a></p>		<p>4)I've found this method for running cmd from code on IoT	<a href="http://www.iot-developer.net/windows-iot/uwp-programming-in-c/command-line-uwp-programming-in-c/executing-command-line-commands" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.iot-developer.net/windows-iot/uwp-programming-in-c/command-line-uwp-programming-in-c/executing-command-line-commands</a></p>		<p>The funny thing is <strong>Windows.System.ProcessLauncher</strong> and related classes don't seem to exist.</p>		<p>I guess the closest I got to configuring the apps as startup is the 4th method described, though I still need to figure out what happen with the ProcessLauncher or if I may require some specific version of SDK for using it.</p>		<p>Already wasted several hours trying to make this work, so if anyone has any insights or ideas please let me know! :)</p>	"

POST to [http://localhost:8080/api/iot/appx/startupHeadlessApp?appid={String64AppPackageFamilyName}!App](http://localhost:8080/api/iot/appx/startupHeadlessApp?appid={String64AppPackageFamilyName}!App) from withing 'auto-update' application after installing new packages. This may look like an ugly workaround, however no other method worked."

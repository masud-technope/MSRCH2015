If that is your concern simply setup SSL and remove all non-SSL listeners. (See pg. 24). That should limit all traffic to an encrypted channel. Then if you wish add password / user authentication (pg. 38) to complete the security.</p>		<p>Alternatively, depending on your configuration, you could block unapproved ip addresses at the firewall level (i.e. block access to the port that your broker is listening on to all addresses except for the temperature sensor) or using eMQTTd's built in ACL facility (pg. 25). That would be less secure than a full SSL setup but depending upon your needs it might be enough.</p>	"

Here is the simple code to open a connection:</p>		<pre><code>private static final String CONNECTION_STRING = "comm:com42;baudrate=9600;bitsperchar=8;stopbits=1;parity=none";	try {	    CommConnection comm = (CommConnection) Connector.open(CONNECTION_STRING);	} catch (IOException e1) {	    e1.printStackTrace();	}	</code></pre>		<p>And here is the exception:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>java.io.IOException: ECOM-COMM: Invalid connection descriptor.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>I think there might be some problems with the <code>CONNECTION_STRING</code> but I couldn't find any examples. anyone can help me?</p>	"

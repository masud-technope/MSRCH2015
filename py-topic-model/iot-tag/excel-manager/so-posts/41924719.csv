What I actually want to do is that suppose that the person enters the shop I want to show him the welcome notification or any other text from the MySQL database.	Is it possible to do so ? I have searched alot but I am not very well impressed with any solution. 	Can anyone please give me the right tips and code.</p>	"

There are two key things you need to know how to do to solve this problem:</p>		<ol>	<li><p>You need to set up your app to detect beacons and send a notification when the beacon is detected.  You can see an example of how to do this with the <a href="http://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Android Beacon Library</a> here:</p>		<pre><code>public class BeaconNotificationApplication extends Application implements BootstrapNotifier {	  private static final String TAG = "BeaconReferenceApp";	  private RegionBootstrap regionBootstrap;	  private BackgroundPowerSaver backgroundPowerSaver;		  public void onCreate() {	    super.onCreate();	    BeaconManager beaconManager = org.altbeacon.beacon.BeaconManager.getInstanceForApplication(this);		    // By default the AndroidBeaconLibrary will only find AltBeacons.  If you wish to make it	    // find a different type of beacon, you must specify the byte layout for that beacon's	    // advertisement with a line like below.  The example shows how to find a beacon with the	    // same byte layout as AltBeacon but with a beaconTypeCode of 0xaabb.  To find the proper	    // layout expression for other beacon types, do a web search for "setBeaconLayout"	    // including the quotes.	    //	    //beaconManager.getBeaconParsers().clear();	    //beaconManager.getBeaconParsers().add(new BeaconParser().	    //        setBeaconLayout("m:2-3=beac,i:4-19,i:20-21,i:22-23,p:24-24,d:25-25"));		    // wake up the app when a beacon is seen	    Region region = new Region("backgroundRegion",	            null, null, null);	    regionBootstrap = new RegionBootstrap(this, region);	    backgroundPowerSaver = new BackgroundPowerSaver(this);	  }		  @Override	  public void didEnterRegion(Region arg0) {	      sendNotification();	  }		  @Override	  public void didExitRegion(Region region) {	  }		  @Override	  public void didDetermineStateForRegion(int state, Region region) {	  }		  private void sendNotification() {	      NotificationCompat.Builder builder =	            new NotificationCompat.Builder(this)	                    .setContentTitle("Beacon Reference Application")	                    .setContentText("An beacon is nearby.")	                    .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher);		    NotificationManager notificationManager =	            (NotificationManager) this.getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);	    notificationManager.notify(1, builder.build());	  }    	}	</code></pre></li>	</ol>		<p>You can read more about details of detecting beacons with the Android Beacon Library on the project website.</p>		<ol start="2">	<li>You need to set up a SQL database that stores your beacon messages, then modify the <code>sendNotification</code> method above to query that database for the beacon identifiers and show the proper text.  The Android developer website has a good tutorial of how to store date in SQL and retrieve it here:</li>	</ol>		<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/databases.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/databases.html</a></p>	"

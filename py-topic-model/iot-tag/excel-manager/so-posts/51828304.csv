Here might be some.</p>		<ol>	<li>In Cognito, there are no appropriate permissions for Update/Get Shadow both for authenticated and unauthenticated pool</li>	<li>The ARN of the Cognito Pool id as well as the IoT are incorrect</li>	<li>Check the IAM policy and the following policy to the Cognito users, Also for the Cognito user, you have to attach AttachPrincipalPolicy policy to give them appropriate permissions for Get/update the shadow. The policy below should be in the Cognito Auth and UnAuth roles.</li>	</ol>		<p>Policy : </p>		<pre><code>{	"Version": "2012-10-17",	"Statement": [	    {	        "Effect": "Allow",	        "Action": [	            "iot:AttachPrincipalPolicy"	        ],	        "Resource": [	            "*"	        ]	    }	] }	</code></pre>		<p>To suscribe to changes <code>$aws/things/thing_name/shadow/update/accepted</code></p>		<p>And to publish the data to the shadow <code>$aws/things/thing_name/shadow/update</code></p>		<p>Also do check if you are able to connect to the shadow.</p>	"

When I publish and subscribe to shadow/update I can see the message, but when I subscribe to update/accepted, nothing shows up. So my question is why is it not being accepted. Also when I subscribe to update/rejected nothing shows up either."

55001091,55003535,55001091,2,0,Tue Mar 05 13:05:00 EST 2019,1527,"<p>There are off the shelf microstepping drivers which allow control of a stepper motor less than one step, but I don't know of any which allow a fraction of a third - usually they divide a step by powers of two.</p>		<p>The arduino stepping library supports microstep divisions of 2, 4, and 8 so you could look at what is done in the code <a href="https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Stepper/pull/5/files#" rel="nofollow noreferrer">there</a> and change that for a ⅓ division. Then you take two ⅓ steps for 1.2 degrees.</p>	"

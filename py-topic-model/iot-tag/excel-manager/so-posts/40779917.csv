After a long exploration i found few Raw Ir codes, which looks like - </p>		<pre><code>"IR": "40064,1,1,96,24,24,24,48,24,24,24,24,24,48,24,24,24,24,24,48,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,1057,96,24,24,24,48,24,24,24,24,24,48,24,24,24,24,24,48,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,1057,96,24,24,24,48,24,24,24,24,24,48,24,24,24,24,24,48,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,5128"	enter code here	</code></pre>		<p>And it's very sad that even after getting this code i am unable to understand this code, I am using this aruino library - <a href="https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote</a></p>		<p>where for sending raw codes is like this - </p>		<pre><code>void  IRsend::sendRaw (const unsigned int buf[],  unsigned int len,  unsigned int hz){	// Set IR carrier frequency	enableIROut(hz);		for (unsigned int i = 0;  i &lt; len;  i++) {	    if (i &amp; 1)  space(buf[i]) ;	    else        mark (buf[i]) ;	}		space(0);  // Always end with the LED off	}	</code></pre>		<p>Where buf is an array containing intervals in microseconds during which signal will be low or high.	But the IR code i got above isn't working, because i think it's not having the time intervals but something else. Any lead would be gracious.</p>	"

Make sure you use the exact TSOP sensor for this experiment. I have noticed many times, the values that you copy from the serial monitor has problems. Good luck!"

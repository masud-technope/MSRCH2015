Use the following code to properly build the object.</p>		<pre><code>Map&lt;String, Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; payload = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();	Map&lt;String, Object&gt; innerPayload = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();	innerPayload.put("0", 1);	payload.put("rlysw", innerPayload);	</code></pre>		<p>Eric</p>	"

BTW I can't find this tips stated in any of the doc write up in pubnub website and this format is highly necessary. I think you should hv others let know and have included it too."

IoThub is the service where the messages sent by the devices arrives to an endpoint, to be read later by the stream analytics job that send the telemetry to powerbi. Also I found a service called thingsboard that can be an option but I want to know what other options exist.</p>		<p>The real-time module of power bi is not very good and isn't customizable. I need a service where I can do more things:</p>		<p>-Create multiaxis graphics</p>		<p>-Zoom on graphics</p>		<p>-Query different periods of time</p>		<p>-Store data for minimum one year (Optional)</p>		<p>-Create alerts and alarms when data exceeds a threshold</p>		<p>-Create advanced alerts and alarms(example: the sum of two variables exceeds a threshold for two minutes)</p>		<p>-Export data(csv,xlsx,pdf, etc)</p>	"

I'm using an open source python implementation for the client and the server.(<a href="https://github.com/FreeOpcUa" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/FreeOpcUa</a>)</li>	</ul>		<p>At the time being, the sensor values can be read and it works fine. </p>		<p>The problem is that some of my sensors also accepts commands, so in a sense they can become actors as well. For instance, a sensor can have different reading-modes. I can change these modes by giving it an change-command. The control-unit <code>"client"</code> accesses the sensor <code>"server"</code>.</p>		<p>My question is that: </p>		<ol>	<li>How can I model commands with <code>OPC UA</code>? </li>	<li>I would like to use methods on the sensor <code>"server"</code>. Can I generate on the sensor an <code>OPC UA</code> event through a method call?</li>	</ol>		<p>Has somebody done something similar than this with OPC UA? I would love to hear your suggestions.</p>		<p>Thanks a lot!</p>	"

Go for it. In fact, the spec explicitly mentions that method nodes can have <code>GeneratesEvent</code> and <code>AlwaysGeneratesEvent</code> references.</p>	"

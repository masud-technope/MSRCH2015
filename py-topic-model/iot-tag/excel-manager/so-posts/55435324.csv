IOW. the begin of the dialog is externally triggered by an event and this event and not the user starts a dialog. Can this be done?</p>		<p>I am a NodeJs convert from one of the two other dialog management systems and know how to write a dialog and have limited know-how on google assistant to react to events.</p>		<p>There is an IOT device that sends GPRS messages to a google assistant device in case of a status change. This should trigger a push event on the assistant's host device which speaks a message about the event and allows the recipient to control further actions through a predefined dialog.</p>		<p>An 'alarm' on 'google home' fulfills the first requirement: Not the user but an external event (timer) triggers the dialog without there being a permanent connection during the timer countdown. 	This alarm, however, does not seem to be a dialog as it only allows to 'stop' it. </p>		<p>As far as I found does it seem hard -and was impossible some time ago- to barge into a device without prior activation by a user. I do not know if it is possible to emulate a user request action to initiate a dialog or if there are better ways to push an event to initiate an intent that starts -without having been activated by the user- a dialog. (Those dialogs are approved and expected by the user)</p>	"

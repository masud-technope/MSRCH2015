But as I don't have clarity over this I am asking questions). Then, in what scenarios do we prefer to use configuring device twins over sending telemetry.</p>	"

Device twins are JSON documents that store device state information including metadata, configurations, and conditions (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins" rel="nofollow noreferrer">source</a>).</p>		<p>You see the difference? Device twins can, for example, be used to configure the telemetry reporting interval. </p>	"

In other words, the telemetry data using a streaming endpoint (path)."

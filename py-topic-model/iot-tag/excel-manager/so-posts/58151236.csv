Configured, deployed and made a subscription to hello/world topic just as the documentation detailed. However,  when I arrived at the testing step here: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/lambda-check.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/lambda-check.html</a></p>		<p>No messages were showing up on the IoT console (subscription view hello/world)! I am using Greengrass core daemon which runs on my Ubuntu machine, it is active and listens to port 8000. I don't think there is anything wrong with my local device because the group was deployed successfully and because I see the communications going both ways on Wireshark.</p>		<p>I have these logs on my machine: /home/##/Desktop/greengrass/ggc/var/log/system/runtime.log:</p>		<pre><code>[2019-09-28T06:57:42.492-07:00][INFO]-===========================================	[2019-09-28T06:57:42.492-07:00][INFO]-Greengrass Version: 1.9.3-RC3	[2019-09-28T06:57:42.492-07:00][INFO]-Greengrass Root: /home/##/Desktop/greengrass	[2019-09-28T06:57:42.492-07:00][INFO]-Greengrass Write Directory: /home/##/Desktop/greengrass/ggc	[2019-09-28T06:57:42.492-07:00][INFO]-Group File Directory: /home/##/Desktop/greengrass/ggc/deployment/group	[2019-09-28T06:57:42.492-07:00][INFO]-Default Lambda UID: 122	[2019-09-28T06:57:42.492-07:00][INFO]-Default Lambda GID: 127	[2019-09-28T06:57:42.492-07:00][INFO]-===========================================	[2019-09-28T06:57:42.492-07:00][INFO]-The current core is using the AWS IoT certificates with fingerprint.  {"fingerprint": "90##4d"}	[2019-09-28T06:57:42.492-07:00][INFO]-Will persist worker process info. {"dir": "/home/##/Desktop/greengrass/ggc/ggc/core/var/worker/processes"}	[2019-09-28T06:57:42.493-07:00][INFO]-Will persist worker process info. {"dir": "/home/##/Desktop/greengrass/ggc/ggc/core/var/worker/processes"} 	[2019-09-28T06:57:42.494-07:00][INFO]-No proxy URL found.

First one is, You can check all messages by subscribing to # (wild card) in test interface. If there is no implementation or configuration error, you must see your messages.	And my second advice is you can check GGCloudSppoler.log which is located under [greengrass]/ggc/var/log/system folder to monitor send request status."

I want to, instead of port-forwarding the cam feed, take the feed and stream it to a web page. The web page would have some rudimentary controls to control a toy car (similar to <a href="https://sidigital.co/articles/lab-sid/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a>)</p>		<p>How can I stream a Raspberry Pi camera feed to a web page with controls to control a toy car?</p>	"

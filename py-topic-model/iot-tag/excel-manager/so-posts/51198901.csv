I have configured the sensor using an android application (using NFC) as in the manual. For the configuration, I followed the manual (<a href="https://www.multitech.com/documents/publications/manuals/S000665.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>) of the base station and a youtube tuto (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_25lZWcSWI&amp;t=850s" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>), but I still do not know how it works.</p>		<p>Now I want to know how to receive a data from this sensor using the cited base station.</p>		<p>PS: the multitech bas station is equipped with a lora antenna.</p>		<p>Thank you for your help.</p>	"

Then, you have to "Save and Restart" the system. After that, you can add all the nodes you need by only using the AEP.	It is recommended to "Save and Restart" each time you do a modification on the system. Elsewhere, the modifications risk not to be considered by the system.</p>		<p>For more information, please visit the YouTube channel of Multitech: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-Nw7I6yCuY&amp;t=296s" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-Nw7I6yCuY&amp;t=296s</a></p>		<p>Good luck.</p>	"

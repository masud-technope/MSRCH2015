Pocket pc 2003 released more than 10 years ago and it's operating system is Windows CE 4.X which is also very old.. Even in this case, is it also possible to use?

It is certainly possible to port it to CE 4.x but that might not be simple. The main thing that the C SDK depends on and that could be challenging is an SSL stack.	There is a <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/doc/porting_guide.md" rel="nofollow noreferrer">porting guide</a> that explains how the SDK is architected and how one can port to new platforms.</p>	"

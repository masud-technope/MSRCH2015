For context: I am trying to understand what are all the location tracking capabilities in IoT sensors. Specifically, the question is, if I want to track location of a sensor, is GPS the only answer, or are cellular, LoRaWAN, etc. also provide location tracking through non-GPS means?</p>	"

But this requires LoRaWAN gateways with high precision timestamps.

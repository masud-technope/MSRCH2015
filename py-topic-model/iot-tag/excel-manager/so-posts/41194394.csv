The number of the devices is still rising, therefor I have to scale out the broker cluster and data processing module accordingly, for the MQTT broker such as Kafka/Rabbit MQ/Hive MQ can be scaled out very easily, but for the data processing module I'm not quite sure whether there is any best practice, or any framework/architecture can achieve this very easily:</p>		<p>I assume I have to create many daemon processes with hundreds and thousands threads to listen on the MQTT broker, the question is how to scale out these services dynamically?</p>		<p>Thanks.</p>	"

However, the problem here is that Kafka does not support MQTT out of the box and has its own conventions. Therefore, there is a need for some sort of adapter to make them work together. For that, take a look at this:	<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33374422/using-mqtt-protocol-with-kafka-as-a-message-broker">using mqtt protocol with kafka as a message broker</a></p>	"

I assume that i'm going to use the RabitMQ as the MQTT broker, and use the Node.js libraries to subscribe the data from the MQTT broker. the next question is where should i deploy the Node.js application to process the data from the broker all the time? the Node.js server? in contrast to other libraries such as Java or .Net MQTT libraries, what's the strength the Node.js has?"

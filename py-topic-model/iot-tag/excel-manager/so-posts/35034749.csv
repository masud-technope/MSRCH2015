Right now I connected the bluetooth module to 5V pin of Arduino through 10K and 22K resistors to limit the volt.</p>		<p>But shall I connect the bluetooth module to 3.3V pin so that I don/t need resistors? </p>	"

Arduino will correctly read 3.3V from the Bluetooth module as a 1. And giving 5V data signals to the Bluetooth will not damage it. Just make sure that the power supply is 3.3V"

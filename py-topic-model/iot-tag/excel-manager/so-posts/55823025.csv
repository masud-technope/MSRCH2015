(No object can be identified from those images, they are that blurry)</p>		<p>I am in desperate need of help to display images that can at least identify the object in the image.</p>		<p>The code that manipulates the pixel image data is </p>		<pre><code>function display(pixels, pixelcount, flag) {	    var i = 0;	    for(y=0; y &lt; yres; y++) {	       for(x=0; x &lt; xres; x++)	       { 	           i = (y * xres + x) &lt;&lt; 1;	           pixel16 = (0xffff &amp; pixels[i]) | ((0xffff &amp; pixels[i+1]) &lt;&lt; 8);	           imgData.data[ln+0] = ((((pixel16 &gt;&gt; 11) &amp; 0x1F) * 527) + 23) &gt;&gt; 6;	           imgData.data[ln+1] = ((((pixel16 &gt;&gt; 5) &amp; 0x3F) * 259) + 33) &gt;&gt; 6;	           imgData.data[ln+2] = (((pixel16 &amp; 0x1F) * 527) + 23) &gt;&gt; 6;  	           imgData.data[ln+3] = (0xFFFFFFFF) &amp; 255;	           ln += 4;	       }	    }		    if (flag == 0xFF) { // last block	       ln = 0;        	       ctx.putImageData(imgData,0,0);	       ws.send(\next-frame\);    	    }		 }	</code></pre>		<p>Thank you in advance</p>		<p>I am following this tutorial</p>		<p><a href="https://medium.com/@mudassar.tamboli/esp32-ov7670-websocket-video-camera-26c35aedcc64" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://medium.com/@mudassar.tamboli/esp32-ov7670-websocket-video-camera-26c35aedcc64</a></p>	"

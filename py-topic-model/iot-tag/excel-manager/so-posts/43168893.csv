Floats can be exchanged for integers with the right scalar, however, I am curious how others would solve this. </p>		<p>E.g. take a temperature reading that needs an accuracy of 0.01 degree Celcius. </p>		<p>Which lead to the following questions, should you:</p>		<ul>	<li>Standardize per device capability (e.g. with and without an FPU in Hardware)</li>	<li>Standardize system wide</li>	<li>Make it flexible, but inform the backend what is used, float or integer, with and without scalar. This would always require a translation at the backend.</li>	</ul>		<p>I know this can be considered a broad question, but I cannot find nice examples or standards on this matter. Would like to hear your thoughts on this subject or links to nice examples to get more inside on already used standards.</p>	"

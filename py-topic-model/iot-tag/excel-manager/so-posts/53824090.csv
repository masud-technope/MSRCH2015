The following steps were derived from the article "Using the Unified Write Filter (UWF) on Windows 10 IoT Core."</p>		<p>This process worked on Iot Core version 10.0.17134, however, the UWF package file names are different for the 17763 packages.	After installing the Windows_10_IoT_Core_ARM_Packages.msi from the iso, the packages:</p>		<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\MSPackages\retail\arm\fre\Microsoft-IoTUAP-UnifiedWriteFilter-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~arm~~.cab</p>		<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\MSPackages\retail\arm\fre\ Microsoft-IoTUAP-UnifiedWriteFilter-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~arm~en-us~.cab</p>		<p>were copied to the device into the folder u:\UnifiedWriteFilter</p>		<p>The following commands were ran from a remote powershell session:</p>		<ul>	<li>u:</li>	<li>cd UnifiedWriteFilter</li>	<li>applyupdate –stage Microsoft-IoTUAP-UnifiedWriteFilter-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~arm~~.cab</li>	<li>applyupdate –stage Microsoft-IoTUAP-UnifiedWriteFilter-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~arm~en-us~.cab</li>	<li>applyupdate –commit</li>	</ul>		<p>The device then appears to install the packages successfully.	Upon restart, the following commands were ran from a remote SSH session:</p>		<ul>	<li>uwfmgr.exe volume protect c:</li>	<li>uwfmgr.exe volume protect u:</li>	<li>uwfmgr.exe filter enable</li>	<li>shutdown -r -t 0</li>	</ul>		<p>When the device restarts, the "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We''l restart for you" screen appears with:</p>		<p>Stop code: KMODE exception not handled.</p>		<p>What failed: vwififlt.sys</p>		<p>This process has been repeated using two different SD cards.</p>		<p>Is there something that I am doing incorrectly to install and enable UWF for version 17763?</p>	"

It seems that you can not protect the data volume(U:) via command <code>'uwfmgr.exe volume protect u:'</code>. But it can be protected using the GUID for the volume.</p>		<ol>	<li>Use putty or other tool to connect with the device through SSH, and then redirect to the root of partition <code>C:</code>;</li>	<li>Get the volume information via command <code>dir /AL</code>,you will get the GUID for the data volume:	<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IeiBs.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IeiBs.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></li>	<li><p>Run the command to protect the volume with GUID which got from last step:</p>		<p><code>uwfmgr.exe volume protect \\?\Volume {GUID}</code></p></li>	</ol>	"

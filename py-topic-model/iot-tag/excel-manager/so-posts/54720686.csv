I am making a dynamic topic and have a rule for the same that transfers the message to lambda and the lambda does some backend processing. I am now trying to subscribe to the topic in my node app that I am republishing through my rule engine action.	I am new to AWS IOT SDK and I am stuck because of the "null" I am getting, please guide me.</p>		<p>I tried to visit the doc of <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js" rel="nofollow noreferrer">aws-iot-sdk</a>, followed the steps they have written but I am not able to get through the same.	If I simply publish and not subscribe in the node app, I am getting the response via SNS, but not able to get back in the app.</p>		<p>My Node code:</p>		<pre><code>ar awsIot = require('aws-iot-device-sdk');		var name = 'My Thing name';	const TAG = '[' + name + '] &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ';	const INIT_DELAY = 15;	var app = awsIot.device({	    keyPath: 'My private key',	    certPath: 'My Cert path',	    caPath: 'My Root cert Path',	    clientId: name,	    region: 'the region',	    host: "&lt;host addr&gt;",	});							app.on('connect', () =&gt; {	    try{	        app.subscribe('/postacttest/response', (event) =&gt; {	            console.log(event);	        });	    } catch(err) {	        console.log(err);	    }		    app.publish('/getacttest/client1', JSON.stringify(	        {	            state: {	                desired: {	                    message: "GET_TEST_RESULT",	                    clientId: "AWSNODECLIENT"	                }	            }	        }	    ));		})	</code></pre>		<p>Following is the response I am getting:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>null</p>	</blockquote>		<p>Following is the rule I am writing on AWS:</p>		<pre><code>SELECT state.desired.clientId AS clientId 	FROM "/getacttest/#" 	WHERE state.desired.message="GET_TEST_RESULT"	</code></pre>		<p>Please guide me that how should I subscribe to the topic and show the result as we can do using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mqtt.js</a>, that is like WebSocket.</p>		<p>If I configure my connect object as below I am getting the error as shown in the same pic'c terminal area below:	<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cJCvE.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cJCvE.png" alt="Error Dec]"></a></p>		<p><strong>I have written all allow and action policy for my ACT service.</strong></p>	"

Thanks @blt for taking out time to read my question"

For an internal project POC and demonstration it would be great if i could reuse that client. I wanted to know if they made it available or a library that could be quickly used to reproduce similar functionality.</p>	"

There are plenty of client references there, including a <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/" rel="nofollow">Javascript client</a>.</p>	"

I dont know if you have been in AWS IoT MQTT Client but it is very nice. I was hoping to find it was open source or available to be reused for an internal testing tool."

For the latter I have experience with IEEE1722 (IEEE 1722 - LAYER 2 TRANSPORT PROTOCOL WORKING GROUP FOR TIME-SENSITVE STREAMS).</p>		<p>As I looked into IoT and the home domain (I use that term loosely to include appliances, security, environment, landscape maintenance) I had hoped to find a standard command and control protocol, for example something analogous to IEEE1722.1, but applicable to command and control in the home domain. </p>		<p>I did some searching and I see there are a number of packaged solutions (i.e. products and software recommendations) available.  There are also a number of kits out there (e.g. RPI3 and Beaglebone Black, TINI) that would be useful platforms for a type of home controller however I found no mention of a standard protocol for command and control of the home apps.  We have the lower layer protocols like IP, TCP, UDP, SSL, HTTP ... etc but as far as I could tell no standard application layer protocol.</p>		<p>Does such a protocol standard (either formal or de-facto) exist?  If so could you please provide a pointer to it?</p>		<p>BTW there was a hit on my search in Stackoverflow:<br>	"Is there any standard for Smart Home?"  But from what I could tell that was someone asking for the answer to questions posed by their classroom lecturer.  It had -1 votes.  My questions is not that.</p>		<p>Thanks in advance.</p>		<p>Jim</p>	"

If you're looking for something application-layer for time sensitive device control, [OpenSoundControl](http://opensoundcontrol.org/introduction-osc) might fit the bill. If you want something silly, [RFC 2324](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2324.txt) turns 20 years old next month. :)"

I have used django REST api so far to get data using HTTP requests, by using JSON. Now I want to further expand my project with the use of django websockets. How can I use websockets with REST api to capture real time data from iot? Or is it even possible to use websockets with REST api.</p>	"

But you can combine websockets with django using [django-channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html). You can of course use serialisers and views from DRF to craft the content of your web socket streams, or include updating a channel when responding to a rest call. But they are more or less orthogonal, i.e. one doesn't preclude the other. They're different parts of your application."

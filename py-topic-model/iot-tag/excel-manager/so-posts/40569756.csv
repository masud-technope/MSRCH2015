Is there any special reason ?</p>	"

If you *actually* do custom embedded Linux projects, then there is no clear cut answer and it will depend on project requirements. If you need a fully open source boot process, it's BBB. If you need an ADC with 8 channels, then the BBB has that out of the box. If you need WiFi, then it's USB on the BBB vs the SDIO connected chip on the RPi3. In the end it will very much depend on actual project requirements."

BBB has external emmc, and has a SD card slot so you can easily use the slot for other purposes, also the OS gets stored on the emmc which has high speed 8-bit parallel interface with the processor. Rpi has it OS on sd card, which if removed is of no use.</p>		<p>So i consider BBB as a miniature full blown linux system best for use in IoT applications. </p>	"

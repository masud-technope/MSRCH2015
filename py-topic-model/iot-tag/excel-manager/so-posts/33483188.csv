The adapter itself is made by Belkin.  Using this, I can see an ip of 169.stuff get generated for my Pi, which is a private ip.  I can deploy code to that from my connected box, however other devices are not able to reach it, and it is not able to make connections out to any servers.</p>		<p>I'm wondering if anybody knows how to bridge the connection.</p>		<p>I am attempting to use the new Azure IoT Hub and the SDK with this in case that makes any differences as that is not a simple rest interface and I believe is some form of socket connection.</p>		<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong>	I have installed a DCHP Server and the Pi gets the ip address: 192.168.0.3 assigned to it.  Unfortunately the Pi still can not ping external sites, such as google.com</p>		<p><strong>Latest Discoveries:</strong> 	I am on a corporate box, which has internet sharing disabled by the system admin.  Following these instructions: <a href="http://zizhujy.com/blog/post/2013/07/07/Solved-Internet-Connection-Sharing-has-been-disabled-by-the-Network-Administrator.aspx">http://zizhujy.com/blog/post/2013/07/07/Solved-Internet-Connection-Sharing-has-been-disabled-by-the-Network-Administrator.aspx</a> Fails.  It shuts down all connectivity to my box and I cannot ping anything or reach the internet or anything.</p>		<p>Thanks,	~David</p>	"

I followed <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Direct-Network-Connection-between-Windows-PC-and-R/" rel="nofollow">these instructions</a> to get it working:</p>		<ol>	<li><a href="http://www.dhcpserver.de/" rel="nofollow">Download DHCP Server for Windows</a>. It is a 100kB download.</li>	<li>Go to the IPv4 properties page of the Ethernet adapter and set a fixed IP address, say 192.168.2.1</li>	<li>Run the DHCP Server Wizard (downloaded above)</li>	<li>Select the Ethernet adapter from the list shown</li>	<li>Save the configuration file and start up the DHCP Server</li>	<li>Click the 'Continue as tray app' button in the server control panel.</li>	<li>Boot up the Raspberry Pi</li>	<li>A popup notification shows the IP address assigned by the DHCP server to the Raspberry Pi.</li>	<li>Use a SSH client, like PuTTy, to connect to the IP address shown</li>	</ol>		<p>Hope this works! </p>	"

I am able to ping from my local box, it has been assigned the ip address: 192.168.1.2 however it cannot establish an outside connection still.  Perhaps I need some form of forwarding?"

You should be all set!</p>		<p>One other thing, if you have a group policy on the machine that is restricting Internet Connection Sharing then take a look at this article to fix the issue.  Note if your organization is constantly sending down the policy then you may have to re-enable Internet Connection Sharing often which is aggravating but at least it will work. 	<a href="http://zizhujy.com/blog/post/2013/07/07/Solved-Internet-Connection-Sharing-has-been-disabled-by-the-Network-Administrator.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://zizhujy.com/blog/post/2013/07/07/Solved-Internet-Connection-Sharing-has-been-disabled-by-the-Network-Administrator.aspx</a> </p>	"

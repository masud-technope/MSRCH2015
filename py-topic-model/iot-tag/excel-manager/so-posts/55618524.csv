So I wonder if there is an  autonimus realtime clock (with a battery) that will loose less than 10ms per month and work for a year?</p>	"

This will be a very difficult target to hit. A typical quartz timing crystal of the type used by most RTCs will drift by 50 - 100+ <strong>ppm</strong> (50,000 - 100,000 ppb) just based on temperature fluctuations.</p>		<p>Most of the higher-quality timing options (TCXO, OCXO, etc) will not be usable within your power budget -- a typical OCXO may require as much as 1W of (continuous) power to run its heater. About the only viable option I can think of would be a GPS timing receiver, which can synchronize a low-quality local oscillator to the GPS time, which is highly accurate.</p>		<p>Ultimately, though, I suspect your best option will be to modify your protocol to loosen or remove these timing requirements.</p>	"

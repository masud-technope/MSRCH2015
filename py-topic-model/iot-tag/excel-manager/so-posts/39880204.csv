At the beginning it was working good, but a few weeks ago it isn't showing any available service.</p>		<p>I thought it was problem of my device, but Arduino IDE is showing the mDNS service (I'm using few nodemcu devices).</p>		<p>So now I don't know where is the problem. In the zeroconf github recommended me to use wireshark to know what happen in the traffic, however I don't see anything unusual on it. <a href="http://txt.do/dantz" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the full log. </p>		<p>I've test in differents environments (windows and linux) and both shows me the same results (not services)</p>		<p>So now I'm thinking it could be problem of zeroconf. There someone who can point me what could be the nexts steps to debug this problem?</p>	"

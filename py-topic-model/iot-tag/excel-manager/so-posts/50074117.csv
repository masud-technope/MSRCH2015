My questions are specific to the Windows Service and TCP Sockets side (I can handle the SAP side).</p>		<p>I would like to receive a little conceptual guidance from someone experienced in Windows Services and Socket. Also, would I need to keep the socket always open in order to be listening for data, rights? I don't need an extensive answer or code; though I wouldn't object to either.</p>		<p>Perhaps this question would be better received in the <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/">Computer Science</a> community? I'm surely not the first to need a solution like this. ;)</p>	"

TCP can require both the client and server to be restarted to get a connection to complete.  A broadcast message you can either restart the client or server at any time to restart the communications.  It sound like you are just receiving status and I would use a broadcast message.  Broadcast is also nice that you can simultaneously have multiple server listening to same data."

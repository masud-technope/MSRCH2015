IOT devices exist, but they provide communication with different iot protocols (mqtt, xmpp, etc.). Can I listen to a single code snippet on the server they send? Which libraries should I research?	I'm sorry for my English. thanks.</p>	"

XMPP is about sending messages between arbitrary devices, MQTT is about providing values for topics, CoAP is about representations of resource state.</p>		<p>High-level gateway software exists that speaks multiple protocols (eg. <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">home assistant</a>), but that's not a library any more.</p>	"

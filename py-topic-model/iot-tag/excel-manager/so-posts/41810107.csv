Does anyone know how many I2C sensor inputs in can handle in parallel? I'm not finding it documented anywhere.</p>	"

41810107,41817835,41810107,2,0,Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 EST 2017,7460326,"<p>Theoretically the DevBoard can handle 127 devices (based on addressing), but realistically with HW constraints in the DevBoard design, it can handle ~8-16 I2C slaves (depending on the inter-connecting wires between all of them).  Capacitance plays a huge role in how stable the bus is.  The Helium Extension boards are optimized to run several devices at once (up to 4 of each type) if needed.</p>	"

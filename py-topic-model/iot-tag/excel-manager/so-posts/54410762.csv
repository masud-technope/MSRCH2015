54410762,54410762,null,1,0,Mon Jan 28 21:48:00 EST 2019,459886,"<p>I have a hard time searching for a reference architecture for IoT that specifies a way of reaching PII Protection regulation compliance (e.g. GDPR). There are lots of articles with general suggestions like <a href="https://www.i-scoop.eu/internet-of-things-guide/iot-regulation/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> or <a href="https://internetofbusiness.com/gdpr-10-steps-to-prepare-iot-projects-expert-panel/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a>, but what I am really seeking is a specific architecture design.</p>		<p>Say, taking Google Cloud Platform as an example, there is the following reference architecture (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/iot/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>): 	<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YBzeU.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YBzeU.png" alt="enter image description here"></a><br>	It does not tell anything about the PII protection, but I can think about implementing or taking a COTS tokenization service (<a href="https://www.protegrity.com/data-security-gateway/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a security gateway</a>), which then shall be deployed to the Edge (which is located in the same country, where a personal information has to be stored under the regulation rules). </p>		<ol>	<li>Does this mean that IoT always has to contain some on-premise edge (playing a single entry point role for all my devices and hubs/gateways) with such the tokenization service installed (of course, for those countries that are under the regulation) if I want to have a storage layer on a public cloud only?</li>	<li>What if I need to store all telemetry that I collect from my smart home, and there is a camera that captures people coming to my door, or even a microphone that has accidentally caught my friend's words like "I am John Doe, my social security number is , and I will not be at my house, which is located at  GPS location for the next 2 days" and my system need to store them as the microphone's state? Does it mean in 'GDPR' locations I need to use on-premise storage instead of a cloud one, to be full compliant, just in case?</li>	<li>Does it all mean that if I need to design a multi-tenant multi-national business of smart homes, that includes countries under the PII Protection regulation, I must always consider a hybrid solution for data storage (on-premise + cloud) to mitigate risks like described in the previous item? </li>	</ol>	"

At this point, I would suggest that your questions are legal/regulatory, not technical."
54410762,95639860,54410762,3,0,Tue Jan 29 06:16:00 EST 2019,459886,"Well, this is still a technical question, I believe, as the target is the architectural approach for such cases, rather than the regulatory itself. I think I'm not the first one who faced this issue, and hoped that guys who have also experienced the problem can suggest what design components could serve the three questions/scenarios I posted. Even if the solution is ad-hoc or not so objective. It is better to have a vision on possible alternatives, then nothing :)"

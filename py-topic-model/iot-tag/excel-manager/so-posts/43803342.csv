Let's say I want to simulate a gps device inside of a virtual machine, I looked a little bit and i found out that i can do it using the command "gpsfake" ( at least this is start but i'm not sure that is really what i'm looking for), i want another iot device virtualized in another virtual machine to constantly get the coordinates from the first VM and then I'll program it to do an action of my choosing later on depending on the coordinates.</p>	"

Adapting the example provided <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js/blob/master/examples/browser/temperature-monitor/index.js" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>, I have been able to register with my thingShadow, and I am trying to publish an update after registration. However, when I do, I get the following error message:</p>		<pre><code>cannot publish to reserved topic '$aws/things/&lt;thingName&gt;/shadow/update'	</code></pre>		<p>I understand the '$' indicates that this is a reserved topic, but Amazon's documentation (<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/topics.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/topics.html</a>)	states that publish and subscribe operations are allowed for this reserved topic. If that is the case, I am not sure why my attempt to publish is resulting in an error. This snippet demonstrates how I attempt to publish in my connection callback:</p>		<pre><code>shadows.register(&lt;thingName&gt;, {	    persistentSubscribe: true	}, () =&gt; {	    shadows.publish('$aws/things/&lt;thingName&gt;/shadow/update', &lt;message&gt;);	});	</code></pre>	"

There's an actual valid thing name here?"

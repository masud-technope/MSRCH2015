Seeing it could be a temporary token or it would only have a limited amount of right.</p>		<p>I you look at azure storage you see the same principles. If you give a user a sas-token only valid for one file for a certain time, he/she could not do much harm. If on the other hand you would give a user a primary key and he/she gets access to the storage name, it would be very easy for the user to delete everything on the storage account.</p>		<p>Also this is an interesting article where you can find some more info on the sas tokens with a deeper explanation: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/servicebus/archive/2015/02/02/event-hub-publisher-policy-in-action.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/servicebus/archive/2015/02/02/event-hub-publisher-policy-in-action.aspx</a></p>	"

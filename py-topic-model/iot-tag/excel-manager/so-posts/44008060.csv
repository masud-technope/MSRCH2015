I mean, should I access somehow to video cameras and use TCP for transporting photos and etc. What is the process of integrating the software in Internet of Things? </p>	"

IoT is nothing it's just a connected entity where sink are different input devices like sensor camera etc and output are different actors like car,humans etc. As in your use case you are connecting camera sources to get multimedia content and provide result to surveillance user."

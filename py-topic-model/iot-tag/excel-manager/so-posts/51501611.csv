You can find that under the following link:</p>		<p><a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/python/api-reference.html#mqttclient" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/python/api-reference.html#mqttclient</a></p>		<p>If you follow through their guide, you will at first also encounter the same issue you are having here, as they do not explain how to properly send a downlink message and provide no examples of it. </p>		<p>The following is what you want to do in order to send a message down while using the ttn library:</p>		<pre><code>client.send("device_id", base64.encodebytes(bytes("DATA YOU WANT TO SEND", 'utf-8')).decode(), port=1, sched="replace")	</code></pre>	"

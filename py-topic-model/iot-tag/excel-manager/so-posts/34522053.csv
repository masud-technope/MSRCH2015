What are the factors that constrain the message length? </p>		<p>If I want to increase the message length, is there a configuration parameter I can modify or which part of the code can I change?</p>	"
34522053,34525013,34522053,2,59,Wed Dec 30 07:34:00 EST 2015,429431,"<p>It's not entirely clear what you're asking here, so I'll answer both possibilities.</p>		<p>The length of the actual topic string is at most 65536 bytes. This is a limit imposed by the mqtt spec, you can't change it. It is also worth noting that the topic is encoded with utf-8, so you may have less than 65536 characters available.</p>		<p>The payload of the message is limited to 268,435,456 bytes. Again, this is defined by the spec.</p>		<p>If you are routinely approaching either of these limits you should be thinking about whether what you are doing is sensible.</p>	"

34522053,56795894,34525013,3,1,Wed Dec 30 10:09:00 EST 2015,429431,"No, but I imagine the limits are the same."
34522053,92850140,34525013,3,0,Wed Oct 24 14:45:00 EDT 2018,201722,"I'd add that one would rarely hit such limits, but that a system should be prepared to handle them if that's a possibility. I would suspect the Mosca broker would stick to the same specs limits."

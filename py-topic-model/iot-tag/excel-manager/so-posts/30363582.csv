I am using the HMCatalog app and the HomeKit Accessory Simulator for testing purposes. </p>		<p>The issue I'm seeing involves my mobile app and the HMCatalog app. I was under the impression that HomeKit syncs through a user's iCloud account. When I am signed in with my iCloud account on one phone (Phone A), any Homes/Rooms/Accessories that I add on in the Catalog on Phone A will show up in my mobile app on Phone A.</p>		<p>However, when I use Phone B, and sign into the same iCloud account, I don't see the same data in Phone B that was in Phone A. The information appearing in HM Catalog appears it is staying on the individual device and not being stored in iCloud.</p>		<p>Has anyone else seen this? Is this an issue with HomeKit? With the Catalog app?</p>	"

Sometimes it depends on the network you are in (some block _hap services).</p>		<p>Best way to test it is with a local USB dongle and put the accessories in the dongle network. This should limit the propagation issues.</p>		<p>Hope it helps.</p>	"

It's an iOS issue, and after a lot of agonizing hours, this worked for me:</p>		<ol>	<li>Ensure the device has iOS version > 8.1</li>	<li>Log out and log back in iCloud.</li>	</ol>		<p>See the following thread. It should be fixed in iOS > 8.1 however, may appear intermittently.</p>		<p><a href="https://devforums.apple.com/message/1054540#1054540" rel="nofollow">https://devforums.apple.com/message/1054540#1054540</a></p>	"

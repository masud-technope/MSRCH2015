But there is one thing: I want to get rid of all these pre-installed apps and other things. I want to create my custom image so to say. There is a nice article <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn916104%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="here">here</a> but it somehow doesn't work for me.</p>		<p>I can't select the "<strong>The Windows image is based on Microsoft packages</strong>" option in the "<strong>Select imaging source format</strong>" dialog. Why? I installed everything correctly.</p>		<hr>		<p>EDIT: According to <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/iot/2015/12/14/windows-10-iot-core-image-creation/" rel="nofollow">this new blog post</a> I need to install the Windows ADK (done) and the IoT Package (done - The Raspberry Pi 2 Tools). And it also says:</p>		<p><em>"When these installations are complete, directories called FMFiles, MSPackages, and OEMInputSamples will exist in your development computerâ€™s C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10 directory."</em></p>		<p>No for me :( I don't know why.</p>	"

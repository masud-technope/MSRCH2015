I have a form.html which has 3 buttons "Forward", "Backward", "Stop" and they will have to call a process get and appropriately send messages to the backend component to take appropriate action.	My sample node.js that comes when I create the application is good, but it does not have form processing, so a link to some worked examples would help a lot.</p>	"

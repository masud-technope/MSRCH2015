So i wanted to access those data by REST API which i found this: <a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/apis/swagger/v0002-beta/info-mgmt-beta.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/apis/swagger/v0002-beta/info-mgmt-beta.html</a></p>		<p>Specially wanted to use this 	<code>/device/types/{typeId}/devices/{deviceId}/state/{applicationInterfaceId}</code></p>		<p>And i created schema by following this: <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/courses/labs/create-device-schema-internet-things-platform-service-ibm-bluemix-dwc013/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.ibm.com/courses/labs/create-device-schema-internet-things-platform-service-ibm-bluemix-dwc013/</a></p>		<p>Then i requested to <code>/api/v0002/applicationinterfaces</code>, <code>/api/v0002/schemas</code>. </p>		<p>But both result was: 	<code>	{"results": [], "meta": {"total_rows": 0}}	</code></p>		<p>How can i create schema and application interface?</p>	"

In which case view the documentation for developing applications <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/applications/api.html#api" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/applications/api.html#api</a>, in particular you can access the last event for a particular device using the last event cache e.g. /api/v0002/device/types/{deviceType}/devices/{deviceId}/events</p>	"

On this link refer Last Event Cache. The REST will return the "payload" field with encrypted value. Just decrypt that value and you will see the sensor data.</p>		<p>Thanks,	Rahul</p>	"

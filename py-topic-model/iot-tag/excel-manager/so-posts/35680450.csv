Now I would like to change from Ethernet to Wi-Fi.</p>		<p>The ESP8266 (or another module under $10) can provide a mechanism to operate as a network adapter, ignoring the internal IP stack and sending the "low-level packages" to the Ethernet/IP stack already implemented in the current solution (something like a "totally transparent and bidirecional bridge")?</p>		<p>Furthermore, this Wi-Fi module can listen multiple ports simultaneously, for example: 80/443 for HTTP/S and 161 for SNMP?</p>		<p>If this requires a custom ESP firmware or some MQX modifications, can you provide some guidelines?</p>	"

You can send UDP packets or can establish TCP connections. But unfortunaly there is no API for sending only packets.</p>	"

For that you need the AT command firmware. http://bbs.espressif.com/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=1703 Take a look at the at command documentation and the examples. http://bbs.espressif.com/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=1022 I'm not sure if you can create multiple TCP servers at the same time. But with AT+CIPMODE you can set the UART-WiFi passthrough mode."

I think TCP would be possible too, right? I think I could send these packages to the MQX stack. Do you think ESP8266 could listen to multiple ports simultaneously?"

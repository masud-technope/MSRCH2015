The OS is just scrapes of one and lacks lots of stuff that we devs use.	Such as, the system.net.networkinformation.networkinterface namespace.	Which i'd like to use to get my systems MAC-Adress.	One other issue i came across was that i can't really seem to find the right access to save/load and modify files locally on the device.	Any tips or tricks?</p>	"

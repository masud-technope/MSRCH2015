There is no official android library for firebase but i used this <a href="https://github.com/firebase/firebase-arduino" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/firebase/firebase-arduino</a> for several projects and it works like a charm. For android you get enough study material through a google search. It is very simple, fast, reliable. Basically you share a common database. You can either write in firebase from app, then read in arduino (use this for open/close valve) or you can write from arduino and read in app (get sensor data or smt). Do some research, start the project, come back with more concrete questions. Good luck! :D</p>	"

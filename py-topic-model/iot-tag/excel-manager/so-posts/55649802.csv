I'm trying to run helloworld sample code for the same. </p>		<p>I am able to publish data through PC (x86 arch) on IBM watsob cloud. For this I have installed cmocka-1.1.0 as per instructions given in follwing github link by IBM (<a href="https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-embeddedc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-embeddedc</a>)	I am using Embedded C Client library for publishing data. I am able to see data published on device details (recent events tab). </p>		<p>For device I have cross compiled iot-embedded-c source using ARM architectire (using sierra wireless toolchain for WP 85) . Toolchain source is available on (<a href="https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airprime/software/wpx5xx/wpx5xx-firmware-release-15/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airprime/software/wpx5xx/wpx5xx-firmware-release-15/</a>).</p>		<p>After successful compilation of iot-embedded source few .so files and .a files were generated. I tried to copy these files to device /usr/lib using yocto recipe and successfully copied .so files (I was unable to copy .a files). After bitbake and make on yocto , yocto image was created which I have flashed in device. </p>		<p>Now I tried to run helloWorld app to publish data to IBM watson cloud device which was already registred successfully with following command but it retured with error code as -82 which I am unable to find error code list of IBM watson website doc. Please suggest me to resolve this issue.  </p>		<pre><code>root@swi-mdm9x15:~# ./helloWorld	Sample expects minimum of 5 args.

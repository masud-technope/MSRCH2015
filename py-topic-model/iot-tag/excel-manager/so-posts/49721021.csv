Am I correct that sx127x 433Mhz or Lora modules give better RSSI signal strength  in buildings at all? 	On BT I get's big difference about 20 - 40 between two reads in one/two seconds (ex. -70 and -92). 	On lora after first tests I get 2-3 (ex. -112 and - 114).</p>	"

I put together a modem using an off-the-shelve LoRa transceiver, at approximately 905MHz, transmitting at about 200mW and the thing was communicating 10 miles to the base station on a tower (line of sight).</p>		<p>LoRa has very low data throughput, it would never work to transmit music for example.</p>	"

Bluetooth works on 2.4Ghz, which is the same frequency as WLAN. I think it depends on what you want to transmit. </p>		<p>Due to the lower frequency of LoRa it will better penetrate buildings. But be aware, LoRa is available in many frequencies, but only some of them will be allowed in your area. If you use a restricted frequency you can get into some big troubles.</p>	"

Bluetooth signal is digitalized via FSK and LoRa is CHIRP which makes them different by nature also.</p>		<p>If you are searching for a single network gateway capable of supply an entire building a LoRa gateway would be more appropriate because it can reach several kilometers range.</p>		<p>Hope it helped let me know in any case.</p>	"

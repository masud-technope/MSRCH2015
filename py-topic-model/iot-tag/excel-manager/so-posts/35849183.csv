Something like delay , bandwidth , roundtrip , packet drops , QOS , etc . </p>		<p>Can you suggest me some software with examples to simulate a simple client broker scenario ? . </p>		<p>I would run the test on an arduino based sensor nodes , sending data to a raspberry pi acting as the gateway . Also i wish to use Eclipse Paho as the client and HiveMQ / Mosquitto as the broker . 	It would be better if you can give examples that can support the hardware that i am using . </p>		<p>Thanks a lot</p>	"

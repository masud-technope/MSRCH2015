I want to read input from Arduino  when my relay goes to normally close state from normally open or vice verson.	If I have more then 10 relay I want read 10 input from Arduino board.</p>		<p>Is is possible if yes please explain.</p>	"

If your relay have no free contacts then add an intermediate relay with 2 contact groups. And use one group of contacts in your target schematic, second use for connecting to Arduino.	Generally talking there are lots of ways how to connect relay to Arduino. The choice depends of your current schematic, available equipment etc. </p>	"

36545146,60745230,36545704,3,0,Tue Apr 12 12:31:00 EDT 2016,4661589,"This depends on particular relay model. In general you should connect one pair of unused contacts. Look at this example: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Button"

Do you want to read only 10 inputs and neglect other or you want to read 10 inputs at a time?	both cases are possible.</p>	"
36545146,60745405,36547814,3,0,Tue Apr 12 12:35:00 EDT 2016,4466202,"well, its very much less likely that you relay have input of 220v. yes, your relay can switch out electrical equipment working at 220 volt. but general input will be 12 volt, 15 volt....  I still strongly suggest that you check that."
36545146,60744609,36547814,3,0,Tue Apr 12 12:18:00 EDT 2016,4410328,"My relay would be 220 volt , hence I dont want to step down and feed input to arduino board. I just want to input my relay state to  arduino board. Probably I need open or close circuit detection per relay is this possible ?"

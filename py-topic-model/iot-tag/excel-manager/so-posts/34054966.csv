My goal is to implement MQTT Topic Authorization in the same manner it is implemented for JMS topics. Actually I am looking the code on the "andes" repository and "carbon-business-messaging" repository, and I would be very grateful if you can suggest me where to start. (that's a lot of code to look at)</p>		<p>What I want to do is to allow a particular user to publish/subscribe topics using the User Role permissions, so that even if someone connects to the Broker, he/she can't subscribe or publish without permission.</p>	"

This is located in andes core.</p>		<pre><code>processSubscribe(ServerChannel session, SubscribeMessage msg, String clientID, boolean cleanSession)	</code></pre>		<p>Also to get an idea about the how authorization Done in JMS messaging you can refer AndesAuthorizationHandler.java Class from <a href="https://github.com/wso2/carbon-business-messaging/blob/master/components/andes/org.wso2.carbon.andes.authorization/src/main/java/org/wso2/carbon/andes/authorization/andes/AndesAuthorizationHandler.java" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

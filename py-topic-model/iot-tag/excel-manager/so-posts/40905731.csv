But at device end we always got Status Code <strong>600</strong>. </p>		<p><strong>Note:</strong> </p>		<p><strong>1.</strong> We are able to Get &amp; Post from any other REST Api using AT command, which we are host in Azure &amp; able to get status code 200. </p>		<p><strong>2.</strong> We call our own REST service via AT command, which is host in Azure, purpose of this service to post data into IOT Hub using azure C# SDK. We get status 200.   </p>		<p><strong>3.</strong> We can not use Azure C SDK due to device incompatibility. so we using IOT Hub Rest API call via AT command. </p>	"

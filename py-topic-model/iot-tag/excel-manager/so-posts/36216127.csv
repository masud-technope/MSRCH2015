Are you trying to add that system to the list of systems in Trusted Hosts?  I am assuming that's your intention, but it's better that you rephrase your question telling us what you're trying to accomplish, as opposed to a single command failure.		 To clarify the difference in "char:9" and "char:54", that's literally the character letter, on that line, in this case after "Set-Item."  In general, that points you to the 'start' of the problem it's referring to (or at least where the problem begins to show up)."

Your question would make sense if you intend to develop software for arbitrary devices - otherwise you'd already know what's on the RPi. That's part of device management. Although you probably *shouldn't* allow the device to self-register its abilities for security reasons. Imagine a hacked device that started reporting sensor data for imaginary sensors"

Right now, it looks like it is only possible via the website (<a href="https://vorto.eclipse.org/#/import" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://vorto.eclipse.org/#/import</a>).</p>		<p>At <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/vorto/swagger/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.eclipse.org/vorto/swagger/</a> there is a 'Vorto Importer Plugin API'. I guess this API is only for importing plugins as the name suggests.</p>		<p>If this is not available, are there any plans to implement such a function?</p>	"

You can "only" import models via the Repository Web Interface (<a href="https://vorto.eclipse.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://vorto.eclipse.org</a>)</p>		<p>However there is a GitHub issue about your request: <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/issues/1667" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/eclipse/vorto/issues/1667</a> and it will be available in 0.12 Release, which is planned for end of august.</p>		<p>The Vorto Importer Plugin API is an API to implement an Importer Plugin that you can register with the Vorto Repository. An Importer plugin could for example be a Web Of Things or JSON Schema Plugin, that converts these 3rd party descriptors to Vorto Information Models. As I understand your question, that is not what you wanna do :) </p>	"

For specific roadmap and issues not related to Bluemix check out https://developer.ibm.com/answers/index.html.  I doubt anyone will list when it will be available as it is competitive information...  I have voted to  close the question as it is not a programming question."

So you will most likely (since it is a <em>mature</em> protocol) find the bulk of devices communicating via something else than TCP/IP.</p>		<p>The specification mentions a <a href="http://www.bacnet.org/Tutorial/BACnetIP/index.html" rel="nofollow">BACnet Broadcast Management Device</a>, which would be most likely the communications endpoint talking to Bluemix.</p>		<p>Using the <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/internet-of-things/" rel="nofollow">IoT Foundation Service</a> in Bluemix, you can reach Bluemix trough: TCP, UDP, MQ, MQTT, HTTP - basically anything that sends IP.</p>		<p>Have a look at the Bluemix service <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/node-red-starter/" rel="nofollow">NodeRED</a> that gives you head start.</p>		<p>What I would do:</p>		<ul>	<li><a href="http://nodered.org" rel="nofollow">NodeRed</a> runs on PC or Raspberry PI too - use <a href="http://thethingbox.io/" rel="nofollow">Thingbox</a> for the PI</li>	<li>The PI has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TJIrnAPsw4" rel="nofollow">shown to run BACNet</a></li>	<li>You even can buy <a href="http://www.cbmsstudio.com/store/p10/Raspberry_PI_Software_Bundle.html" rel="nofollow">BacNET for PI</a></li>	<li>Now the tricky part (we could collaborate on that): build some Nodes for NodeRED to do the BacNET interaction</li>	</ul>		<p>With this approach you decouple the local BacNET network from the cloud. I would then use MQ(TT) to talk to the cloud, so you don't loose data when there is a connection challenge (e.g. you use 3G).</p>		<p>Does that help? </p>	"

BACnet/WS is the new RES Web Service standard from BACnet.</p>	"

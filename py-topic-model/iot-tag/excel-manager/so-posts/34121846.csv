I do not clearly understand what octet means. So as I understand an octet is a byte.</p>		<p>So is the data transferred binary?</p>		<p>Or what means octet exact?</p>		<p>Please can someone give me a sample message. It is really bad that there is not example message in the specification.</p>		<p>Thanks,	Mathias</p>	"

If the first byte is 0x01 then the next 2 bytes are the length, else the value of the first byte is the length.</p>		<p>The next byte is a type, a table of valid message types can be found in sections 5.2.2 in the <a href="http://mqtt.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/MQTT-SN_spec_v1.2.pdf" rel="nofollow">spec</a></p>		<p>The Message body varies depending on the type.</p>		<p>But to publish a message with payload <code>HelloWorld</code> on Topic ID of AB (0x41, 0x42) would look something like this:</p>		<pre><code>0x0F  - length (15 bytes total, including length)	0x0C  - msg type (publish)	0x02  - flags (QOS 0, topic name)	0x41  - topic ID 1	0x42  - topic ID 2	0x00  - MsgID (00 for QOS 0)	0x48  - H	0x65  - e	0x6C  - l	0x6C  - l	0x6F  - o	0x57  - W	0x6F  - o	0x72  - r	0x6C  - l	0x64  - d	</code></pre>		<p>Where the topic id is the output from a topic register message (Section 6.5 in the spec)</p>	"

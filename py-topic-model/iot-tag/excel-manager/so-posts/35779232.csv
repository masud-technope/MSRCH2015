I am following the instructions exactly:</p>		<p>I created a txt file called myTestPolicy.txt like this:</p>		<pre><code>{		    "Version": "2016-3-3", 	    "Statement": [{	        "Effect": "Allow",	        "Action":["iot:*"],	        "Resource": ["*"]	    }]	}	</code></pre>		<p>placed in the local folder, but when I run the command:</p>		<p><strong>aws iot create-policy --policy-name "PubSubToAnyTopic" --policy-document file://myTestPolicy.txt</strong></p>		<p>I get an error:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p><em>A client error (MalformedPolicyException) occurred when calling the CreatePolicy operation: Policy document is Malformed</em></p>	</blockquote>		<p>Totally stuck, googling yields no answers, can anyone help?</p>	"

He opened a ticket with engineering.</p>		<p>In the meantime, I was able to do this from AWS Dashboard (the IoT web UI allows you to create a policy and also do the other tasks that the (dysfunctional) CLI documentation is trying to guide you through.</p>	"

Usable link costs between Routers may range from 1 to 4, with 1 being the best.  As a result, the maximum number of hops between Routers with good links is 16.  Considering that links to end devices are not included in the route cost, it is possible to add another hop at each end of the Router path, making the actual hard limit 18 hops.  Any paths that have one or more link costs greater than 1 will reduce the maximum hop count.</p>	"

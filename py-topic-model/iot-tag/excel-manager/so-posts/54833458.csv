I got Ubuntu installed on it and created a couple of snaps after connecting to ubuntu-core.	The snap which was created is a armhf.snap file. When I run the snapcraft command, it gets built fine with no errors. But when I try to install the snap on my local environment, It gives me an error saying "snap requires classic confinement which is only available on classic systems". 	I tried using sudo install snap --dangerous snap_name.snap --classic and I still get the error.	When I just run sudo install snap snap_name, I get an error saying "cannot open snap".	Can anybody help me out?</p>		<p>Thanks.</p>	"

I installed it now and tried running it, Im getting an error saying "cannot open sname_name.snap". I also have a doubt if I should install snap in the classic confinement or the local environment. I have tried both anyways."

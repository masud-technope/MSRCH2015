There are multiple versions of the NodeMCU, so be sure to note that when searching.	Here's the pinout for one of more popular the versions.	<a href="https://bennthomsen.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/nodemcu_pinout_700-2.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://bennthomsen.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/nodemcu_pinout_700-2.png</a></p>		<p>The NodeMCU uses the ESP8266 chip, so the instructions you find for the ESP8266 will apply.</p>		<p>Also, if you are just getting started, you should be aware that the ESP8266 has some security issues (anyone can just read your code, and hence your wifi password off of the device). The ESP32 is a nice alternative without the same security flaw.</p>	"

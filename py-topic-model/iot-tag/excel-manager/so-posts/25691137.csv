My only hesitation about using websockets is because I need to update an array on the webserver fairly often and this seems like a PUT rest operation.  Thanks</p>	"

For example, if you are using socket.io than passing arrays in the form of json exists.  </p>		<p>Performance wise websockets perform better and in the use case you are using, I don't think there is a wrong way but I think websockets are the way to go here.</p>	"

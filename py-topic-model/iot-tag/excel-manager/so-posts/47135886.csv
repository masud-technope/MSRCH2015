I mean it can receive data in binary(Physical network layout data)	or higher data abstraction layout like Datalink layout, network layout, ...</li>	<li>Is that any way to send data to Kafka directly?</li>	<li>If not, is it possible to customize Kafka source code to fit the	situation?</li>	</ol>		<p><strong>Generally</strong>, is it possible to send data from sensors to Kafka using UDP protocol?</p>	"

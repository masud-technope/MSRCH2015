I've adding just a single APK file <code>main.apk</code> to a <code>ZIP</code> file. Then I've tried to push it to a RPi which is sitting nearby. But the main.apk would not be launched on the device.</p>		<p>Things I've tried/done:</p>		<ul>	<li>Download <code>Empty bundle</code> with <code>Things Build ID</code>=<code>NIH40K</code></li>	<li>Creating a Bundle and pushing it to devices through <code>OTA UPDATES</code></li>	<li>Creating a new <code>FACTORY IMAGE</code> with that newly created bundle</li>	<li>Still my app would not be started</li>	<li>I've checked, my app's MainActivity has <a href="https://github.com/ViliusKraujutis/Android-Things-Demo/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L24" rel="nofollow noreferrer">action=MAIN and category=IOT_CATEGORY</a></li>	<li>Tried running app from my laptop via <code>adb connect Andorid.local</code> and it works as designed</li>	</ul>		<p>But I couldn't make an OTA update. Anyone succeeded doing so?</p>		<p>Here's my project on Github:	<a href="https://github.com/ViliusKraujutis/Android-Things-Demo" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/ViliusKraujutis/Android-Things-Demo</a></p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

You will get an Android Things image. Flash it to your RPi as you did when you flashed the Android Things regular image. <a href="https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/raspberrypi.html#flashing_the_image" rel="noreferrer">https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/raspberrypi.html#flashing_the_image</a></p>		<p>From now on, your RPi will check if a different version of your product has been pushed from the console. The check happens every 5 or 6 hours so you might have to be patient. Also your RPi needs to have internet access.</p>		<p>3 - Upload another bundle to your console, create a build configuration for it and then push it to your devices via the OTA updates panel of your console.</p>		<p>4 - You will need to manually reboot the RPi to apply the update.</p>		<p>This article from Dave McKelvie is a good example in my opinion : <a href="http://android.geek.nz/hello-android-things-developer-console/" rel="noreferrer">http://android.geek.nz/hello-android-things-developer-console/</a></p>	"

Turns out if your custom animation is misconfigured the main apk will fail to load and it will never be launched. I solved the problem by installing a stock build with empty bundle. Using adb to connect and retrieve the existing animation. I then used this animation along with my main apk to create a bundle. I loaded this image on my device and my main app loaded just fine.</p>	"

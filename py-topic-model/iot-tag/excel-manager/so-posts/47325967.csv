I am a total newbie to HART. I know that is (traditional) HART uses 4-20mA signal modulation to transfer additional information. HART-IP is leveraging HART to Ethernet. I also know that are DTDs, DTMs and FDTs...so far so good.</p>		<p>But I haven't found any resources describing how to start using HART-IP, not to mention in combination with Java.</p>		<p>I would assume, that with HART-IP I don't have to care about signal modulation anymore but just "firing" my commands and receive the response.</p>		<p>Has anyone a good starting point for the work with HART-IP?</p>		<p>Regards,	Thomas</p>	"

It's used to communicate to HART field devices via a network-connected WirelessHART gateway or other HART-IP enabled instruments.</p>		<p>In order to get the specifications for the protocol, you need to either become a member of FCG (expensive, but comes with tech support) or purchase them for $1000 (still expensive, but not nearly as much).  </p>		<p>You are correct in that you do not have to worry about the 4-20mA signaling modulation with HART-IP, but you will be responsible for setting up the TCP/IP or UDP sockets to the WirelessHART gateway and constructing the frames in accordance with the HART-IP protocol.  These are essentially the standard HART commands wrapped in HART-IP-specific Ethernet packets.</p>		<p>However you choose to obtain the specifications, you will have a fair amount of development work ahead of you.  From what you are describing, you are trying to develop a HART host application.  There are no APIs or DLLs available for HART-IP so you'll be building from the ground up.</p>	"

Buy it from HART authorized companies which most of them are in Europe<br>	If you wanna do it by your self you need to get specification documents from Field com.</p>		<p>Best Regards</p>	"

I just want to update the value of field1 to 1 and 0.	If I just type this url in any broswer,my thingspeak data will be update.All I need to do is to write code like typing in any broswer of this url.	In that way I think I can turn on and off my led through android application for my IOT project.I think all I need to do is to make connection between apk and thingspeak from this url.I am new to android studio.I have tried many ways.Help me please.

To answer your question:</p>		<pre><code>try {	  // create the HttpURLConnection	  url = new URL(yourUrl);	  HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();		  // just want to do an HTTP GET here like your browser would	  connection.setRequestMethod("GET");		  // give it 15 seconds to respond	  connection.setReadTimeout(15*1000);	  connection.connect();	} catch (Exception e) {	  e.printStackTrace();	  throw e;	} finally {	  connection.disconnect();	}	</code></pre>		<p>There are better (cleaner) ways to do his, but this should answers your question.</p>		<p>PS: Be aware that in Android you will not be able to do this on the main thread! You should do this in a AsyncTask, AsyncTaskLoader, ...</p>	"

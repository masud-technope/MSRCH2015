I can see my rules in my aws console under Amazon IoT, along with my thing, cert, and policy. I am using Mosquitto like they suggest for testing it, and I can see my message when I subscribe to my topic.</p>		<p>But I am having an issue that, when I publish a message, I don't see anything in my DynamoDB or the CloudWatch logs from Lambda. And in IoT, I am able to create a resource and see my roles, db table, and lambda function as if it's working. I am keeping to what the tutorial is saying and nothing extra. I can't find any other forum that has discussed Amazon IoT or is having this issue.</p>	"

I added a new subscription (my email), and when I publish with Mosquitto it worked! I got an email. So I wonder what is happening with the db and Lambda function?"

It will store value of field DeviceId coming in json as primaryKey"

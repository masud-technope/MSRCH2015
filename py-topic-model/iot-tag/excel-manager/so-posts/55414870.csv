I have deployed LambdaFunction_1 on my AWS-Greengrass core which is RaspberryPi 3 to be the local lambda function. I want to invoke LambdaFunction_1 from LambdaFunction_2. The local lambda function can't be invoked for strange reason that I can't understand.</p>		<p>To deploy the local lambda function (LambdaFunction_1) I have to upload a zip file containing the python file of the code and the greengrasssdk. Importing this greengrasssdk in the code makes it unable to be invoked!</p>		<p>This is the code for LAmbdaFunction_2 which is on cloud: </p>		<pre><code>import json	import boto3	invokeLam = boto3.client('lambda')	def lambda_handler(event, context):   	payload = {'test-key': 'Hi, you have been invoked!'}	response_F1 = invokeLam.invoke(	                               FunctionName = 'LambdaFunction_1', 	                               InvocationType = 'RequestResponse', 	                               LogType='None', 	                               Payload = json.dumps(payload) 	                              )	data_F1 = response_F1['Payload'].read()	print (data_F1)	return	</code></pre>		<p>This is the code of LambdaFunction_1 which is deployed on greengrass core: </p>		<pre><code>import json	import greengrasssdk	def function_handler(event, context):	    print (event)	    return 'Hello From Function 1'	</code></pre>		<p>The output should be "Hello From Function 1" in the log file of Function 2. But the response is 	{"errorMessage": "Unable to import module 'LambdaFunction_1'"}</p>		<p>BUT: 	when I remove (import greengrasssdk) line from the code of function one it works perfectly. 	Is this problem logical?</p>	"

44437364,76080564,44446792,3,0,Wed Jun 14 12:38:00 EDT 2017,4871566,"@OlivierBlock Thank you for your reply. We are currently looking for an SDK to use for AMQP communication. For this we already created a few prototypes, also one using the Microsoft Azure SDKs. All of the previous ones are working as expected. The question was if RabbitMQ could also be one of the possible candidates, as we would not be bound to Azure using it. After having a talk with one of your Cloud Solution Architects at Microsoft in Berlin (Germany), I am pretty sure it is not possible because of the version difference in the used AMQP protocol (0.9.1 to 1.0 seems not to be possible)."

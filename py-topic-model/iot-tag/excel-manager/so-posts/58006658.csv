Now i have installed Arduino extension on VSCode and it is working fine but now i want to use <a href="https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk" rel="nofollow noreferrer">esp-open-sdk</a> to add more features. But the build process is very complicated and is not working for me i am not being able to build the code.</p>		<p>The error that VSCode is giving is that it is not being able to find the imports</p>		<h1>import â€œESP8266.hâ€?</h1>		<p>Although i cloned the library and added it to include search path in the c++ extension.</p>		<p>So my question is is there a way to either compile the cloned library into a usable sdk that i could import in VSCode?</p>		<p>Or is there some other way i could import the library and include it in my program.</p>	"

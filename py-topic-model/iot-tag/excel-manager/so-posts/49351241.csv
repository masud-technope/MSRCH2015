49351241,49351241,null,1,1,Sun Mar 18 18:06:00 EDT 2018,733601,"<p>I have an IoT device that needs to support various operations, one of which is <code>next</code> from the <code>Alexa.PlaybackController</code>. My device is a multimedia device and requires many of the other Controllers as well. I'm including the <code>Alexa.PlaybackController</code> in the discovery response for my devices like so:</p>		<pre><code>{	    "type": "AlexaInterface",	    "interface": "Alexa.PlaybackController",	    "version": "3",	    "supportedOperations": ["Next"],	}	</code></pre>		<p>I've also tried:</p>		<pre><code>{	    "type": "AlexaInterface",	    "interface": "Alexa.PlaybackController",	    "version": "3",	    "properties": {	        "supported": [	            {"name": "next"}	        ]	    },	}	</code></pre>		<p>but neither work. I get a schema error on CloudWatch:</p>		<p><code>is not valid under any of the given schemas</code></p>		<p>Looking below at the schema, I see that <code>PlaybackController</code> indeed is not included inside the schema. However, all of the documentation makes it seem like this should be trivial. I'm wondering if I need to include something else to indicate that playback is something that I need. </p>		<p>Is <code>PlaybackController</code> special in some way and unable to be included in combination with other Controllers? I've tried googling about this schema error but it's too vague and nothing's coming up.</p>		<p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>		<p>__</p>		<p>EDIT:</p>		<p>I see now that video devices seem to get a different set of available Controllers, but there is still reference to using <code>PlaybackController</code> in a lot of places around the regular Smart Home Skill for entertainment devices. Really hope that it's possible! </p>	"

I'm using the python validation class <a href="https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smarthome/blob/master/sample_lambda/python/validation.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">provided by Amazon</a>. Turns out that the schema from the same repo simply doesn't include any reference to <code>Alexa.PlaybackController</code>. Therefore, the validation fails every time with the error about mismatching schemas. Maybe they've added some controllers recently and forgot to update the schema.</p>		<p>I submitted an issue to the Smart Home repo here: <a href="https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smarthome/issues/62" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/alexa/alexa-smarthome/issues/62</a></p>	"

49404170,85847141,49404170,3,0,Thu Mar 22 07:53:00 EDT 2018,4238935,"What is the library version for the PN532 you are using? I think the problem can be in the authentication command. In the libraries I am looking on the internet I see these parameters in the authenticateBlock function: "uint8_t * uid, uint8_t uidLen, uint32_t blockNumber, uint8_t keyNumber, uint8_t * keyData". In your case the uid of the card is a uint32_t variable, maybe you need to retrieve the uid or reconvert in a uint8_t variable, can you please share the authenticateBlock function definition you are using?"
49404170,49424886,49404170,2,0,Thu Mar 22 09:26:00 EDT 2018,2425802,"<p>The combination of the SENS_RES (ATQA) = 0x0044, SEL_RES (SAK) = 0x00, and the UID = 0x04B9C9BA204B80 suggest that your tag is a MIFARE <em>Ultralight</em> tag or an <em>NTAG</em> tag. However, the code that you show in your question is designed for access to MIFARE <em>Classic</em> tags.</p>		<p>MIFARE Ultralight/NTAG tags don't support the authentication mechanism performed by <code>nfc.authenticateBlock()</code> (which is specific to MIFARE Classic). As a result the code will fail on <code>nfc.authenticateBlock()</code>. Since your tag does not support that type of authentication (it might support a different mechanism though), you could try to skip the authentication step and only use read/write methods. These should work (with some limitations, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/48404824/2425802">Byte array gets truncated when writing to memory of RFID tag using Adafruit PN532 library</a>) for your tag type.</p>	"

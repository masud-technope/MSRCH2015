But I couldn't find service is able to plot GPS log data.	For example, AT&amp;T M2X can visualization and log data that just sensor data (like humidity, temperature, and so on) but it can't visualize map from data. </p>		<p>At last found Azure Maps, but it needs to register the credit card.	If needed to pay for the amount of user data, but I want to start map visualization with no pay option setting first.</p>		<p>I desire service keeps below three points, 1. no need pay option setting first, 2. it can post data from HTTP protocol(GET/POST), 3. any kinds of map type is ok (google map, BingMap, OpenStreetMap, and so on)</p>		<p>I'm sorry that my English is so bad. 	I look forward to your reply. 	thanks.</p>	"

That said, Azure Maps also provides free monthly usage limits. Also, in Azure you can set a spending limit on your account. After adding your credit card, simply set your limit to 0 and you don't need to worry about paying. If you exceed the free limits, your account will simply stop working until the next month when you get a new set of free limits. Here is some documentation on how to set a spending limit in Azure: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-spending-limit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-spending-limit</a></p>	"

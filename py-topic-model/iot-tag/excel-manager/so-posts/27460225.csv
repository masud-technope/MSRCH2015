27460225,43470180,27460225,3,0,Wed Dec 17 07:34:00 EST 2014,956810,"I'm interested in a list, as wide as possible. I'm defining my directions within IoT and one of the question I need an answer for is the protocol to use to connect sensors and actuators. ZigBee and Z-Wave are widely used but they are closed protocols. MQTT and CoAP, being open protocols, are more interesting from my point of view."

You can implement any sensors or resources with CoAP and MQTT.</p>		<p>CoAP and MQTT are application layer protocol that uses TCP/UDP to transfer data (for example, sensor readings) over network.	For example in CoAP, all sensors on your hardware are treated as 'resource'. CoAP provides GET, PUT, POST, DELETE interface to manipulate with resource.	It is developers responsibility to attach its custom handlers to above interface. For example, attach read_temperature_sensor_data() to 'GET' interface, attach set_clock_time() to 'PUT' interface etc.</p>	"

Yes, indeed, they are two different entities and my question was about objects that are sensors or actuators and can use 'of-the-shelf' CoAP or MQTT protocols.	In other words: is there any offer in the market that let you get a sensor that can send its reading using one of the two protocols?"

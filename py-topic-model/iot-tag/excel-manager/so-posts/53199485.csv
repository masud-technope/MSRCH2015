The error is definitely occurring on the GridDB side. </p>		<p>I have installed and set up 3 separate nodes of GridDB on Azure. Setting the password works:</p>		<pre><code>[root@node2 gridstore]# gs_passwd admin	Password: 	Retype password: 	</code></pre>		<p>But when I get in there to join my cluster I get errors:</p>		<pre><code>[root@node2 gridstore]# su gsadm	bash-4.2$ /usr/bin/gs_startnode 	bash-4.2$ /usr/bin/gs_joincluster -c &lt;cluster_name&gt; -u \	&gt; admin/&lt;my_password&gt;	A00102: Authentication error occurred.	Confirm user name and password.	</code></pre>		<p>I've tried going back and changing the password to something generic (password) just to make sure it works:</p>		<pre><code>[root@node2 gridstore]# gs_passwd admin	Password: "password"	Retype password: "password"	</code></pre>		<p>but I continue to get the same error: </p>		<pre><code>[root@node2 gridstore]# su gsadm	bash-4.2$ /usr/bin/gs_startnode 	AD0102: gsserver process may exist.	PID is 88153	bash-4.2$ /usr/bin/gs_joincluster -c &lt;cluster_name&gt; -u \	&gt; admin/password	A00102: Authentication error occurred.	Confirm user name and password.	</code></pre>		<p>Since I know for sure the password is now "password" (I've changed it multiple times at this point), shouldn't it be connecting me by now?</p>	"

GridDB currently doesn’t accept passwords with chars like %, etc. </p>		<p>As for changing your password and still not working — did you stop the node (gs_stop node) before changing the pass? The changes won’t stick if you do it while the node is running. </p>	"

We are building an application to analyze the data stored at IoT hub. The application we are building is not hosted at azure yet. What are the possible ways/approaches to fetch this data, so that I can store relevant data at new server using the best approach/way."

Anyways, here are possible options:</p>		<p><strong>Push to AWS:</strong>	IoT HuB => Stream Analytics => Azure Storage or SQL Database => Azure Functions => AWS storage</p>		<p><strong>Pull from AWS:</strong>	IoT HuB => Stream Analytics => Azure Storage or SQL Database &lt;= AWS Lambda => AWS storage</p>		<p>I realize that is vague but you didn't provide much details.</p>	"
44668718,44678489,44668718,2,4,Wed Jun 21 14:08:00 EDT 2017,8084828,"<p>The following is an example of the <em>warm path</em> for your telemetry stream. It is based on the new preview feature for archiving ingested data at the Event Hub. Note, that this preview feature is not built in the Azure IoT Hub, so all events are routed to the custom Event Hub. The period of the archiving events into the Azure Storage Blob (avro blob) can be configured from 1 - 15 minutes.</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FPPk.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FPPk.png" alt="Telemetry Warm Path"></a> </p>	"

For a straight up filtered stream you could use IoT Hub routes to blob storage, then a WebJob or Azure Function triggered on the blob storage to push to AWS. </p>		<p>SQL Azure can struggle under certain high volume situations and ASA is expensive for what it is unless you need actual real time analytics (about $85/SU/month with MS recommending 3 SU's for production ASA jobs).</p>	"

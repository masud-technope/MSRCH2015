As mentioned <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/iot-hub-devguide-quotas-throttling/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>, the IoT Hub will accept messages beyond the limits for a while, but at some point it will refuse the messages (i.e. returns an error). This is something you can detect in your device's code that is sending the events.</p>	"

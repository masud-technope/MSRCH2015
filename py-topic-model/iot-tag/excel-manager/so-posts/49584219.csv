Can we track the GPS module's position using its physical address and since GPS module does not require Internet so how to get the realtime location of the GPS module?</p>	"

You need some network interface. It may be Wifi of GSM. If you use Wifi as Network interface you can use ESP8266 powered Arduino board such as NodeMCU or GSM Shield. Then you can get realtime location updates connecting Arduino with Firebase or such kind of Realtime database. </p>	"

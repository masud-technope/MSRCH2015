For example if one LwM2M can be on the gateway level and another LwM2M server is on the cloud, how could I connect the two servers?</p>		<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>	"

Let's say in my local server (in the gateway) I will be able to manage my devices locally without the need to connect to the remote server (in the cloud). In the remote server I will be able to manage all gateway (can be more than one) and devices."

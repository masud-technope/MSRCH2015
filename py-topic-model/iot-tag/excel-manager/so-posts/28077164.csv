I want that the teacher can add from an application a pdf to download for exemple. So that the students will download the files automatically when entering the classroom with the app.</p>		<p>So that was something simple until I think about how to do it.</p>		<p>If I understood, it's necessary <strong>to have a server</strong>. Send it the files with the appropriated beacon identifier. And to download thoses ( being a student ), doing an download http request ? How can I do, in case I'm a student, to download the beacon attached file and only its files. SO like that I'll have an another beacon to download something else.. </p>		<p>Do you have some clarifications ?</p>	"

You will need to create an iOS and/or Android app to detect the beacon and display the list of files for download.</p>		<p>Once the app detects the beacon, it will show a list of documents to be downloaded for the class.  The list of documents can probably just be posted on a web server or Wiki page for simplicity -- no need to build this.</p>		<p>The main remaining question is how to tie the beacon identifier to the URL showing the list of documents for the class.  There are three ways to do this:</p>		<ol>	<li>Hard code the beacon identifier to URL mapping inside the app.  (Advantage: simple.  Disadvantage: you have to update and resubmit your app for every change.)</li>	<li>Use an off the shelf web service that maps beacon identifiers to arbitrary values, like my company's <a href="http://proximitykit.radiusnetworks.com" rel="nofollow">ProximityKit.</a></li>	<li>Build your own web service to do this.</li>	</ol>	"

Customers are billed based on the number of IoT Hub units that have been consumed during the month.</p>	  	  <p><strong>Is the billing prorated if I purchase an additional IoT Hub unit mid-month?</strong></p>	  	  <p>You can choose to increase the number of IoT Hub units purchased at any time. If you sign up for the service mid-month, your monthly bill will be pro-rated based on the number of days remaining in the month. (<strong>For the purpose of the IoT Hub service, a month is defined as 31 days</strong>). If you increase the number of units of IoT Hub mid-month, your monthly bill will be based on the number of units available for each day during the month.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>So for your example of 8 hours use in a single day will be measured as the monthly rate divided by 31.</p>	"

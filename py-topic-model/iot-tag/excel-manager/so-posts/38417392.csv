38417392,72157591,38417392,3,0,Tue Feb 28 13:36:00 EST 2017,5972487,"But this is what I am asking!! I really don't understand why you gave the question a bad review! If you don't know you don't know.	Let's say I have a RPi that has some sensors connected to it. I want to be able to discover them. Is there a way I can do this without the need for a manual pre-configuration."
38417392,72160585,38417392,3,0,Tue Feb 28 14:46:00 EST 2017,4449516,"There are thousand of different sensors you can plug into a RPI: from a simple on/off switch to a sophisticated 'smart' sensor. So, the answer will yes you can and no you can't; both answers are 100% correct. Unless you can physically identify the 'sensor', the question will be to broad and useless."

In any case no, you cannot get any information of the sensor ifself like this like you would get connecting to USB..."

Temperature sensor, IR sensor? </p>		<p>What is the communication between the sensor and the raspberry pi? Is it via I2C or just an Analog read? </p>		<p>If the communication is done with more sophisticated communication such as Bluetooth or Wifi and has a protocol, then it may be able to query those sensor details</p>		<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong></p>		<p>Nope, Typically what the Rasberry PI sees the sensor is just a raw analog signal or a digital signal of the data. You would need the datasheet or manual of the sensors.</p>	"

38417392,64242110,38417449,3,0,Sun Jul 17 03:26:00 EDT 2016,5972487,"Thank you for your answer. Actually, I don't have a specific sensor in mind, nor a specific type of connection? What I am asking is, is it possible to do that? And of yes what are the options? What I am thinking of is, you have a raspberry pi or and arduino for example, you plug your sensor and you read some details about it, like manufacturer, type, model, etc. I hope I was clear enough."
38417392,64242273,38417449,3,0,Sun Jul 17 03:44:00 EDT 2016,1777840,"Yes and no, it depends on the sensor really."
38417392,64242341,38417449,3,0,Sun Jul 17 03:54:00 EDT 2016,5972487,"Do you have an example of a temperature sensor that I can use for that purpose? Thanks."

I looked up the web for <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/40378/ds18b20-address-finding">python</a>.</p>		<p>So yeah, it depends on sensor rather then functionality of controller. </p>	"

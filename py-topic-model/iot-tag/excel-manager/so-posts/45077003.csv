Originally the sensors where designed to connect with a mainboard which would than send the data received from the sensors to a cloud.	Sadly the mainboard is not working for me, so i used my raspberry Pi 3 to replace it.	Currently i'm able to read standard characteristics defined by bluetooth, such as the Battery level, Manufacturer Name String, etc..</p>		<p>My question is focused on reading characteristics of a Primary Service which is "unknown" to bluetoothctl.</p>		<p>I'm not sure whether the data can't be interpreted correctly or if i'm missing some kind of authentication. </p>	"

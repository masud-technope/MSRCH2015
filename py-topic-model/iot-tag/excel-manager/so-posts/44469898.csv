I have to implement a home automation system for my school project and I want to use Arduino and Firebase.</p>		<p><strong>What I have in my head:</strong>	Connect the Arduino to the internet using the ESP8266-01 WiFi module, integrate the Firebase-Arduino library and then use relays connected to the Arduino's output ports to perform appliance operations.</p>		<p><strong>What I've seen so far:</strong>	All the materials I have seen so far do not actually do anything with the Arduino board, other than flashing the WiFi module.</p>		<p>So my question in essence is, am I I thinking about this wrong, based on what I have in my head? If so, how do I communicate to the relays with the data received from the web?</p>		<p>If what I have in my head is the right path to take, any resources provided will be appreciated.</p>		<p>Thank you very much.</p>	"

Turns out the required Assets\ that are	  referenced in project AdapterBackgroundService file	  Package.appxmanifest are missing. They are present in the	  AdapterHostApp project.</p>	  	  <p>So, to fix:</p>	  	  <ol>	  <li>Copy Assets directory from AdapterHostApp folder to AdapterBackgroundService folder.</li>	  <li>Under AdapterBackgroundService project, right click, Add -> New Filter, call it "Assets" </li>	  <li>Right click on the created "Assets" filter, Add -> Existing Item, and select all files under AdapterBackgroundService\Assets\</li>	  </ol>	  	  <p>This will add all the missing Assets files back to	  AdapterBackgroundService.</p>	</blockquote>		<p>This solved the issue for me.</p>	"

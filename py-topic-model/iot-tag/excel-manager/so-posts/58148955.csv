I have device measurments/events flowing through MQTT channels from IoT gateways to cloud, but I would prefer evaluate rules on edge instead of send more data to cloud. I'm looking for some tool that offers a DSL to write rules and write a minimal glue-code to collect the data that is evaluated. I know few of them (Apache Strom, Drools, Something done with Akka Streams) but it seems that are meant for cloud/distribuited environments, where scalability and fault tolerance are the most important aspects; on the other hand an edge computing app should just have low resource consumption, no scalability and fully configurable from remote. </p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5IC26.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5IC26.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>		<p>I've also thought to build it on my own, but I can't believe does not exist something similar, since it should be a common use case in edge-driven IoT scenarios</p>	"

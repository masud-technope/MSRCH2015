Can anyone suggest me how to analyse the security and privacy level of an application in IoT.?	Also can anyone suggest a best tool to test algorithms for Security and Privacy in IoT.?</p>	"

If you're doing heavy encryption in this device, being able to see what's it's up to in shipping hardware would constitute a security hole.</p>		<p>You're also very vague on what it is you're testing. If you can see exactly what data is being captured and how it is being sent (and where), that's all you need to know; how it's implemented internally doesn't matter.</p>	"

Blynk works fine, but is limited to cell phones. Thus I tried Thinger.io and ThingsBoard.io to send, store and visualize data from remote sensors on Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32 systems.	Unfortunately, the MQTT protocol seems to be blocked by my network (I have no access to the router). Thus, I am looking for code examples using the HTTP protocol.</p>		<p>I tried the example documented at 	<a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/samples/esp8266/temperature/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://thingsboard.io/docs/samples/esp8266/temperature/</a>	Temperature upload over MQTT using ESP8266 and DHT22 sensor</p>		<pre><code>// WiFi and connection to Thingsboard Server	#define WIFI_AP "WLAN-XX"	#define WIFI_PASSWORD "78s1A"	#define TOKEN "eWdqwftFL"	char thingsboardServer[] = "http://192.168.11.103";	WiFiClient wifiClient;	PubSubClient client(wifiClient);	int status = WL_IDLE_STATUS;	unsigned long lastSend;		void setup() {	  Serial.begin(57600);	  // Wifi and Thingsboard	  InitWiFi();	  client.setServer( thingsboardServer, 8883 );	  lastSend = 0;		}			void InitWiFi()	{	  Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi network ...");	  // attempt to connect to WiFi network		  WiFi.begin(WIFI_AP, WIFI_PASSWORD);	  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {	    delay(500);	    Serial.print(".");	  }	  Serial.println("Connected to WiFi network");	}			void reconnect() {	  // Loop until we're reconnected	  while (!client.connected()) {	    status = WiFi.status();	    if ( status != WL_CONNECTED) {	      WiFi.begin(WIFI_AP, WIFI_PASSWORD);	      while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {	        delay(500);	        Serial.print(".");	      }	      Serial.println("Connected to AP");	    }	    Serial.print("Connecting to ThingsBoard node ...");	    // Attempt to connect (clientId, username, password)	    if ( client.connect("ESP8266 Device", TOKEN, NULL) ) {	      Serial.println( "[DONE]" );	    } else {	      Serial.print( "[FAILED] [ rc = " );	      Serial.print( client.state() );	      Serial.println( " : retrying in 5 seconds]" );	      // Wait 5 seconds before retrying	      delay( 5000 );	    }	  }	}	</code></pre>		<p>Expected: Connection to the Thingsboard server.	I tried different ports (9090, 1883, 5683)	Serial console</p>		<pre><code>Found BME280 sensor! Success.

As per my knowledge CoAP layer operates above oBIX handler. Also some interfaces of oBIX is similar to CoAP.</p>		<p>My query is why oBIX is required? Why oBIX is necessary if CoAP is already avaliable?</p>	"

The oBIX specification provides for bindings using REST (using HTTP or CoAP), SOAP, and WebSocket to talk with web/internet.In many cases, your choice of binding may be dictated by the application needs, such as if you are implementing a server in a constrained environment, or for an enterprise level application.</p>		<p>For CoAP binding following CoAP intefaces are mapped with oBIX requests:</p>		<p><strong>OBIX Request - - HTTP Interfaces</strong><br/>	Read - - - - - - - - - GET<br/>	Write - - - - - - - - - PUT<br/>	Invoke - - - - - - - - POST<br/>	Delete - - - - - - - - DELETE<br/></p>	"

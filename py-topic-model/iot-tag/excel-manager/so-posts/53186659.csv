How do I proceed with it?	Basically I want to build a GUI app which would use some API and fetch local air quality (like say I live in Powai,Mumbai) so this should grab the current location and throw the local air quality of that place. I know there are android apps dedicated to this but since I am trying to build it on python I need to know technicalities for building this on python.</p>	"

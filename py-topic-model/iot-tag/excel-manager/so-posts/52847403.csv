The proposal is an autonomous-distributed-controlled light system, in which the lights turn on before pedestrians come and turn off or reduce power when there is no one by means of a distributed-installed sensor network. </p>		<p>I will be adding a few things to the project for energy reduction but what I need to know is how do I perform the simulation to show that this approach would reduce energy consumption? </p>	"

Also you need an energymeter to measure the energy flow with and without your system. Last but not least what is more interesting is the point of material costs + energy costs of your system vs. the already existing systems."

I plan to implement my idea in a similar way as done  [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323560518_IoT-enabled_Smart_Lighting_Systems_for_Smart_Cities) . Is there any way to perhaps do this?"

This lets you create whole networks and set bandwidth and packet drop rates. They provide VMWare <a href="http://downloads.pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil/core/vmware-image/" rel="nofollow">image</a> pre-installed </p></li>	</ol>	"

MQTT message re-transmission only occurs when a connection drops and then is re-established.</p>		<p>As such, you may be better off using something like a proxy or TCP port-forwarder between your client and server, so that you can simulate the connection dropping.</p>		<p>socat is an example of a simple TCP port forwarder:	<a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/</a></p>		<p>The following command listens on port 2883 and forwards connections to 1883 on the same machines:</p>		<pre><code>socat TCP-LISTEN:2883,reuseaddr,fork TCP:localhost:1883	</code></pre>		<p>Typing Ctrl-C will cause it to drop the TCP connection.	socat is available from homebrew on Mac OS X.</p>	"

QOS 1 and 2 just means they are priority over QOS 0. For the brokers that we test that happens after a lot of connections, like 30000 or 40000."

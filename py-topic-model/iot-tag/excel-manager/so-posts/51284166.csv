I have little bit confused in below topic/section that how it work &amp; goes:</p>		<ol>	<li>How to build the bootloader &amp; load it into controller? </li>	<li>how to download the new firmware code(from over the air i.e updated Firmware)?</li>	<li>And how to identify the newer and older version's of code?  </li>	</ol>	"

So new firmware is	active now.</li>	</ol>		<p>The reason why old firmware will download the new firmware is that we want to keep the bootloader code as minimum as possible. So, the application process the new firmware maybe by CRC check. And to upgrade the firmware OTA you need to verify that your new firmware is 100% correct otherwise a single bit error can cause severe problems. </p>	"

51284166,89846672,51319247,3,0,Fri Jul 20 08:35:00 EDT 2018,9653459,"Hi Muhammad, 	You are right, I am also going as per your suggestion. I am working on the STM32L4 controller with GSM module with it. I have read the application note for the bootloader and system memory boot available from the STM website. I also read the In-Application-Programming(IAP) which codes for the firmware version checking & download and all, also there some setting for the booting memory for loading the new firmware in flash memory.	Sir If you have any sample code for these so please can you share it with me."

As I mentioned that i am working on the STM32L4 MCU, So that why I am looking specifically STM32L4 MCU.  	If you have any other such useful link related with STM32L4 MCU for firmware over the air then please share me or you any idea for coding or document related to this then please share me.	Please comment ......"

They have mention about the In Application Programming(IAP) for the Firmware Updates over the air and system memory boot mode says about the selection of the boot using the boot pins(BOOT0, nBOOT,BOOT1 etc). All these thing are okay ..... But here i need to know that how do i set the URL link & download .bin file from URL. In which part of code i have to set url links and all .... 	Please comment  ....."

I've connected it via a FTDI board to my computer's USB port and am sending it AT commands via the terminal. I'm using the AT commands to successfully open a socket in command mode and send the HTTP request. </p>		<pre><code>AT#SD=1,0,80,"google.com",0,0,1	OK	�AT#SSEND=1	&gt; HE�AD� /� HTT�P/1.1			OK		SRING: 1	</code></pre>		<p>I don't understand why these � are turning up. When making requests for google.com this is fine but anything hosted on Heroku gives me a 505 error.</p>		<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 505 HTTP Version Not Supported	Connection: close	Server: Cowboy	Date: Tue, 26 Apr 2016 20:39:34 GMT	Content-Length: 0	</code></pre>		<p>I've read in one or two forums that this 505 response is specific to Heroku and has to do with incorrect spacing in the HTTP request. I suspect the unrecognized characters are creating the problem. What is going on? They consistently turn up before 'A', 'space', and 'P'; there may be other letters also but those are the ones that I've seen.</p>	"

Then I started getting a 400, but I figured that out too!</p>		<p>In the application note for socket dials from Nimbelink (which is a vendor that uses the Telit cell modules--I have one of their modules which has the Telit GE910 on it) it says that after you enter your HTTP request (e.g. <code>GET / HTTP/1.1</code>) you're meant to hit <strong>ctrl+j</strong> twice to signal the end of the request. </p>		<p>Well, I started doing all of my serial communication in CoolTerm so that I could see the HEX I was sending. (My hope was I could catch the � characters--I didn't, in fact they don't turn up in CoolTerm.) <strong>ctrl+j</strong> results in a single line feed (HEX: 0A). According to HTTP documentation, to signal the end of a line you're meant to use carriage return line feed (HEX: 0D 0A). (<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-routing#not-supported" rel="nofollow" title="Heroku also says it has to be formatted like this.">Heroku also says it has to be formatted like this.</a>) This is what I send when I hit <strong>enter</strong>. So if I end <code>GET / HTTP/1.1</code> with <strong>enter</strong> twice, the request gets though. Though even a <code>HEAD / HTTP/1.1</code> request to heroku.com comes back as a 400. But that's up next:</p>		<p>According to RFC (which I found out <a href="http://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=1106" rel="nofollow">here</a>) HTTP 1.1 requires a Host. So if I do the whole thing with the right line endings</p>		<pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1	Host: heroku.com 	</code></pre>		<p>it works! It also works for posting to my server.</p>	"

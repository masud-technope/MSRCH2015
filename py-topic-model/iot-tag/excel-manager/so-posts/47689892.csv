I think my option is to use USB 2.0 to TTL with 6 pins is it correct?	If not what are my option?	for e.g I want to send 234212441325454543595674859764	how can i send it usb to TTL with 4 pins?</p>	"

But if you want to send 234212441325454543595674859764 in ASCII - that is normal case for UART.

Like 2342124413254545 and then 43595674859764 but i want it in on shot like 234212441325454543595674859764."

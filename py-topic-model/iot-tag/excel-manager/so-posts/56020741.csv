But I am unaware that how I would use Haystack tag library to convert data from diverse devices into standard tags using java code.</p>		<p>Where should I start from and how?</p>		<p>I have also tried going through the <a href="https://project-haystack.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation page</a> but what I found is just tag details rather than java sample code to convert it.</p>		<p>I would also like you to help me with the simple java code snippet.</p>	"

You should explicitly try to show what you already have tried, and what exactly your problem is (e.g. your Java code not finding any Haystack classes). I recommend reading [ask] first."

But after exploring the Haystack documentation, I found that it cannot be used as a library. </p>		<p>Instead, we have to clone Haystack Java application from here (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/brianfrank/haystack-java/src/default/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://bitbucket.org/brianfrank/haystack-java/src/default/</a>) and we need to enhance the same application as per our requirement.</p>		<p>After posting in Haystack Forum, I came to know the Haystack java toolkit can be build and embed into whatever kind of application you have.</p>		<p>Please refer this query in Haystack Forum for the same. 	<a href="https://project-haystack.org/forum/topic/722" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://project-haystack.org/forum/topic/722</a></p>	"

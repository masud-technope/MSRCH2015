If no client picks up the message, the message remains stuck in the queue and waits to be consumed. In a message queue, it is not possible for a message not to be processed by any client, as it is in MQTT if nobody subscribes to a topic.	What will happen if the subscriber receives the message but is unable to download it due to lack of connection? What measures can be taken to make sure the client gets the message even after this?</p>	"

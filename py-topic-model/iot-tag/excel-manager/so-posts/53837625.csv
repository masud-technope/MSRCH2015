So i want to implement the usuall server work, like noticing if a device connects/ disconnects etc. to the IoT devices, so no server/hub is needed at home. 	But I can't find good solutions for it, for websockets i need a server, for mqtt a broker and so on, but all need a server.	I found that d2d is done with "LTE" similar technology but i would like to do it with web-protocols.</p>		<p>So my question:	Is there a way to let IoT devices talk to each other over the network?</p>		<p>My IoT devices (raspberry pis) currently use nodejs  with typescript but I'm  not starting a server, they only have a mqtt connection to publish there sensor data to the users.</p>		<p>Thanks in advance.	And if im understanding something wrong, please say it. :)</p>	"

You can run experiments with an ad hoc and a mesh network. You have to define well what you will be investigating and what will be your "research" questions..."

One Raspi hase a Ledstrip connected to it and i want to controll it, thats why it has an mqtt connection, just for receiving a new value for the led and sending real time data to the user. I currently use a public Mqtt broker but i will switch to an amazon broker soon."

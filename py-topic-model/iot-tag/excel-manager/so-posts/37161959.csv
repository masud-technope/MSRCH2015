Now due to some reason I changed the access key, updated the key and token in the MQTT settings, and delivered the code. However, the new key isn't reflected in the VCAP_SERVICES variable. It still shows the old key and token values.</p>		<p>Is this an expected behaviour or a bug?	Is there a solution or workaround for this issue?</p>	"

This is not the AWS publish limit per second but our customized limit on things.</p>		<p>Any possibility to do in AWS IoT security policy on thing certificate? Or topic? This should be first level of limit to reject over-publish before it goes to rule engine.</p>	"

As you know, 	Using certificate is only way to limit per client.	ex) change A client's certificate to inactive when it publish 1000 times a day.	You have to check publishing times per client, and then change certificate's state active/inactive.</p>	"

So that, we can do checking on client publish rate? Else, I didn't find any IoT core service can do request check for publish limit even cloudtrail service."

AWS IoT just support metric for publishing limit per account. ref . https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/metrics_dimensions.html . I don't know what best solution is to check publishing times per client."

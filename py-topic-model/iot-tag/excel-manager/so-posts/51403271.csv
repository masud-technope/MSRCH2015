I have came across that it provides implementation of digital twin but i no where found that kaa only registers the devices data as digital twins or can produce statistical analysis for preventive maintenance.</p>		<p>Our application needs to perform predictive/statistical analysis on device data collected as digital twins to identify any failure cases.</p>	"

The <a href="https://docs.bosch-iot-suite.com/analytics/useexplore/index.html#anchor22233" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorial</a> shows how to get started with anomaly detection.</p>		<p>There is an API to access your Digital Twin data. The technology behind that is the Eclipse Ditto open source project, but that does not contain any advanced analytics functionality when run on-premises.</p>		<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for the vendor.</em></p>	"

In this sample demo, our software collects and visualizes statistical data on a horizontal line chart. </p>		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAuxaDalQYc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAuxaDalQYc</a></p>		<p>To perform advanced analytics on device data collected, you just have to choose your favorite analytics engine and connect it to Kaa (via open APIs) - our platform comes pre-integrated with Kafka, so this should be an easy ride. </p>		<p>Also, you can integrate Kaa with any modern DB you are using, and feed your structured or unstructured data to Kaa without any effort.</p>		<p>In case your devices are not yet connected to the cloud, our IoT engineers would be happy to help you produce smart products for mass market faster.</p>		<p>Has this been helpful to you?</p>		<p>I will be glad to share more information about Kaa and our expertise in similar use cases, you are welcome to contact me directly here or in Linkedin <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aglivinska/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/in/aglivinska/</a></p>	"

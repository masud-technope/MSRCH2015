I am planning to deploy it in cluster mode. </p>		<p>When it is deployed, how two Thingsboard servers communicate with each other?</p>		<p>I got this problem in my mind because a particular device can send a message to one Thingsboard server (A) but actually, the message might need to be transferred to another server (B) since a node in the B server is processing that particular device's messages (As I know Thingsboard nodes uses a device hash to handle messages). </p>		<p>How Kafka stream forward that message accordingly when in a cluster?</p>		<p>I read the official documentation and did some googling. But couldn't find exact answers.</p>	"

These values were stored in a buffer before sending as the website can be accessed only once in 15 mins.  Do I have to follow any specific method to send data from my RaspberryPi ( using Python) while using buffer values (stored values)?</p>		<p>Attached the screenshot of the values received by ThingSpeak ( CSV file). Is there any way to send multiple values to a field by accessing it once in 15 seconds.</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hwqIr.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Screenshot of CSV file generated with ThingSpeak </a></p>	"

Are you trying to read multiple values from a ThingSpeak channel using MATLAB and this is where you are seeing NaN? If so, I can walk you through it.</p>		<p>I created a ThingSpeak channel and stored 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42 in it as [4 8 15 16 23 42]. ThingSpeak stores data in a channel as a string up to 255 characters.</p>		<p>Here's the channel feed: <a href="https://api.thingspeak.com/channels/228314/fields/1/last.json" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://api.thingspeak.com/channels/228314/fields/1/last.json</a></p>		<p>In MATLAB, use the following code to get the data back out of the ThingSpeak channel and use it as a normal vector.</p>		<pre><code>fieldData = webread('https://api.thingspeak.com/channels/228314/fields/1/last.json')	field1Vector = str2num(fieldData.field1)	field1Vector(1)	</code></pre>		<p>If you do not have str2num in your version of MATLAB, you can use eval in the same way.</p>	"

So the output would be:</p>		<pre><code>document(xyz123)	device_unique_identifier = "abcd1234"	timestamp = 10/09/2019 10:00	venue.name = "room A"	</code></pre>		<p>Here is a screenshot how the data may look like:	<a href="https://i.imgur.com/oTL6ROI.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oTL6ROI.png" alt="tracking"></a>	<a href="https://i.imgur.com/ri12dvt.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ri12dvt.png" alt="place"></a>	Reason for tracking data, in a realtime use case, doesnt have the luxury (time) to query the name in venue collection, so insertion (writing) have to be in this way (meaning only the device_unique_identifier is available for insertion). Therefore, to do the relation, we would only do it in the query.</p>		<p>I would like advise how to model and query such a relation.</p>	"

So long as the data lives in multiple documents, you'll need to call each document and collate the data on your end.</p>		<p>The technique that I prefer is to store the data you'll need wherever you'll need it. E.g. if you need to only grab tracking data and it would be overkill to also grab venue data, then store only a bit extra data with tracking (in this case add the name) and you don't have to worry about making multiple calls, the data will already exist where you need it.</p>	"

I'ved not explored that. i thought about that having the venue name to prevent overkill. can firestore store a small db on the mobile ? (in this case venue). that way on tracking data before posting, it can query internal venue database and get the name. is that something that is rational solution (i dont want to create sqlite if possible for this in the mobile, there is something firestore or nice solution to do this) https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/enable-offline"

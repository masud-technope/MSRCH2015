I am sending MQTT messages from device to a pubsub queue on which I have subribed (with something I will call "the server").	From the google cloud console, I update device setting and I get the setting message in device. </p>		<p>Everything in google tutorial work fine but I wonder if it is possible to set up a messaging it the other way : i.e. "the server" sending message to a pubsub queue subscribed by the device using MQTT. </p>		<p>The schema at the end of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/concepts/overview" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this page</a> make me think that only the "config" mqtt queue (/devices/XXXX/config) can be used that way.</p>		<p>What I need is a 1to1 communication from "the server" to "the device" and I'm afraid that the only way is using the config </p>	"

Apparently, although we can publish to <code>/events</code>, <code>/config</code> and <code>/state</code> topics, using MQTT protocol, only topic <code>/config</code> and, maybe, <code>/state</code> can work through subscriptions with the same protocol.</p>		<p>The conclusion I got, after reading many times the documentation, that is not so clear, and asking some questions here at stackoverflow is: you can not use MQTT to subscribe to any topic in order to receive those data sent to <code>/events</code> topic.</p>		<p>To accomplish this, you have to create a Pub/Sub topic associating it to your device:</p>		<ol>	<li>On <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/iot/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google Cloud IoT Core Console</a>, click on your registry ID;</li>	<li>Create a standard telemetry topic;</li>	<li>After topic created, click on the topic to see its details;</li>	<li>Its details will open on <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google Cloud Pub/Sub panel</a>;</li>	<li>In this panel, you can create a subscription to the created topic, by clicking on the "create subscription button".</li>	</ol>		<p>Now that you have a "google cloud pub/sub topic" linked to "google cloud iot core <code>/events</code> telemetry MQTT topic" and a respective subscription, you can use the <a href="http://google-cloud-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pubsub/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">google pub/sub library</a> to receive notifications through created subscription when data are sent to <code>/events</code> topic.</p>		<p>Maybe the following link can also help:	<a href="https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/devices#creating_a_device_registry_with_multiple_pubsub_topics" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/devices#creating_a_device_registry_with_multiple_pubsub_topics</a></p>		<p>I hope this can help you. If I made any mistake in my answer, may someone edit it with some improvement or correction.</p>	"

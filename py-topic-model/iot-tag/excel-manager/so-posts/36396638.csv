The binding is successful when I unbind service from another app and then bind the service to this app. But with service already bound to 4 apps, I get this error when I try to bind the service to 5th app. I was not able to see such a constraint mentioned in documentation of IoT service. Hence just wanted to check if this is something I have overlooked somewhere or is this a bug in the service or in the documentation. If yes to latter is this already logged and has a resolution ETA?</p>		<blockquote>	  <p><em>Error: status code: 502, error code: 10001, message: Service broker error: {"description"=>"Sorry, the IoTF service was unable to process your request."}</em></p>	</blockquote>	"

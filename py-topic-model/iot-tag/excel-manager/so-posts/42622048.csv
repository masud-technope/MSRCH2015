You should use NGSIv2 APIs, please check <a href="http://fiwaretourguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development-context-aware-applications/v2/how-to-update-and-query-context-information/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://fiwaretourguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development-context-aware-applications/v2/how-to-update-and-query-context-information/</a> .</p>		<p>You can design a mechanism that will allow to register users, from their mobile phones, and to only allow those registered users to POST data to Orion. As a result your application will be minimally secure. You can for instance design your own simple token based registration mechanism or even you can use the FIWARE IdM, PEP Proxy and Authorization PDP. See my presentation at <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18LaWZSK4h2wncPF6hNAwK5MToLvJesR3XLrzsqrsmrw/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18LaWZSK4h2wncPF6hNAwK5MToLvJesR3XLrzsqrsmrw/edit?usp=sharing</a> . </p>		<p>The Complex Event Processing can be implemented using FIWARE official CEP, see <a href="http://fiwaretourguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/real-time-processing-of-context-events/introduction/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://fiwaretourguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/real-time-processing-of-context-events/introduction/</a> or you can use alternative implementations such as Perseo <a href="https://github.com/telefonicaid/perseo-fe" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/telefonicaid/perseo-fe</a> , which uses EsperTech rule system. </p>		<p>I hope this helps</p>	"

The communication between the iot device and hub for the purposes of storage occurs over https. Does this allow me to rest assured that the content of my upload is unchanged. I found that with the storage API you can set an MD5 hash but one of the MSFT developers mentioned that https by default will also prevent against bitflips. Is this the case?"

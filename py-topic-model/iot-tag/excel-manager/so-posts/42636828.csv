To consume data in real time you should use Live Objects MQTT interface instead of polling with API REST. If your need is more to be notified of particular events or conditions on data (for example temperature higher than xxx degrees), you can use the Live Object Event  Processing feature, also available through MQTT interface. See Live Objects manual for more details</p>	"

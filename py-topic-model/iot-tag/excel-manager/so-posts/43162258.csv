Here are a couple of options:</p>		<ol>	<li>Run a DHCP service on your laptop to assign the board an IP address.</li>	<li>Connect to the board over serial and assign a static IP address.</li>	</ol>		<p>If the ethernet port in your laptop doesn't autocross, you may need to connect the devices using a crossover cable instead of a patch cable.</p>		<p><strong>DHCP Service</strong></p>		<ul>	<li>Ubuntu: Use a local service like <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/man5/avahi-daemon.conf.5.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">avahi-daemon</a>.</li>	<li>Mac OS: Enable <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25327" rel="nofollow noreferrer">internet sharing</a> on the Ethernet port.</li>	<li>Windows: I have never tried, but others have used <a href="http://www.dhcpserver.de/cms/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DHCP Server for Windows</a> for this purpose.</li>	</ul>		<p><strong>Static IP</strong></p>		<ol>	<li>Use the <a href="https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/raspberrypi.html#serial_debug_console" rel="nofollow noreferrer">serial debug console</a> instructions to connect a serial cable and access the shell.</li>	<li>Connect the Ethernet cable between the board and your computer.</li>	<li>Run the following command as root (replace <code>x.x.x.x</code> with a real IP address):	<code>	ip addr add x.x.x.x dev eth0	</code></li>	<li>Verify that the IP address was set properly with <code>ifconfig</code></li>	<li>Run <code>adb connect x.x.x.x</code> or <code>adb connect Android.local</code></li>	</ol>		<p>The static IP address will only stick as long as the Ethernet link is active. If the device reboots or ethernet is unplugged, you'll have to run this procedure again.</p>	"

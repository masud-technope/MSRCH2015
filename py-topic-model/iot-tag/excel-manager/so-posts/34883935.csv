I have checked the wireing multiple times, but it did'nt seem to fix it...</p>		<p>My Code (python):</p>		<pre><code>import time	import sys	import Adafruit_DHT	import RPi.GPIO as GPIO	import urllib2		sensor = Adafruit_DHT.DHT22	pin = 4	myAPI = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"	baseURL = 'https://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=%s' % myAPI		GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)		while 1:	        print "---------------------------------------"	        humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(sensor, pin)	        desturl = baseURL + "&amp;field1={0}&amp;field2={1}".format(temperature,humidity)	        f = urllib2.urlopen(desturl)	        f.close()	        print temperature	        print humidity	        time.sleep(10)	</code></pre>	"

Rerunning may address that (and you'll never be able to guarantee a particular execution will work). If that still fails, try the higher resistor between the input pin and 3.3V)"

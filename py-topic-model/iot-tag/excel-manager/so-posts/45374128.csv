What we want to accomplish is: </p>		<ol>	<li>Send an event data from a device to IoT Platform</li>	<li>Subscribe the event</li>	<li>Call an OpenWhisk action. </li>	</ol>		<p>We are assuming the event data is JSON format. We know we can develop an application that subscribes to an event on the IoT Platform like: <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/applications/libraries/java.html#java" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/applications/libraries/java.html#java</a>. However, we believe that there must be a more simpler way. </p>		<p>If we look at IoT Platform, we can create an action such as IFTTT, Webhook action, Forward event to cloud, etc. Generally speaking, which way do you recommend to invoke an OpenWhisk action from IoT Platform? </p>		<p>Any comments or suggestions must be appreciated. Thank you.</p>	"

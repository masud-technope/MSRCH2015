I also came up with another app with has controls for the rover's motors. It works fine when i connect this device to a monitor and work with it, but for my purpose it needs to be headless. Is there any way i could remotely access the application. I am stuck up with so many different solutions like duplicating the entire project as webpage or could open the same application is the development machine that they communicate with each other. All i have to do is remotely control the rover with a video preview and even lower fps is acceptable.</p>	"

On SO such questions are not very appreciated. Try to be more specifc, like: "I tried it with this set of tools. The technical difficulty I see here is ..... . How do I solve this problem using .... ?"

You need a second computer (with a head to see the preview video sent from the pi). This second computer will need to be configured in addition to the Win 10 IOT. You did not mention what that second computer was."

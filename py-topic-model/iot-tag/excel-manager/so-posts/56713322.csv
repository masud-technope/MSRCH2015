What you should do is this, in js:</p>		<pre><code>$.post("filename.php",{parameter:value}, function(data) {.$("elm").html(data);});	</code></pre>		<p>Something like this. You put it in a function and the you write this at the end of the script</p>		<pre><code>setInterval(yourfunction(), time)	</code></pre>		<p>And then everything is ok. Go check a little lesson of jQuery, and you should understand this</p>	"

Setting up an AMQP server might be feasible using implementations like Apache QPid but this doesn't seem like a responsibility device should be bothered with.  You could run an API server on a W10 IoT Core device for other devices to communicate with.</p>		<p>There are specific standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllJoyn" rel="nofollow">AllJoyn</a> that lets us communicate device with eachother and Windows IoT Core has native support for this. Take at look at the samples to find out if this fits your scenario: <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/win10/samples/alljoynjs" rel="nofollow">https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/win10/samples/alljoynjs</a></p>	"

I'm looking at small MCU's with little flash and RAM with a minimal possible SDK. </p>		<p>A <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39356224/sending-kaa-events-using-raw-tcp">previous SO</a> mentions the future plans to support REST, MQTT, and CoAP. While a <a href="https://docs.kaaiot.io/DOC/docs/current/Architecture-overview/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">kaa documention</a> states that the 1/KP protocol implementation supports MQTT and is well-thought to enable future CoAP binding. That's saying MQTT is done. Are the REST and CoAP features currently implemented or being worked on, any documentations or official information about that?  </p>	"

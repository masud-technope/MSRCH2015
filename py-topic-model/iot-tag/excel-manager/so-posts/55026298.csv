I could just read the data and send it off through the network, but the data could come in once a few minutes as well as in a flood of occurrences several times a second. So I thought about buffering the data as key->value pairs and checking if a tag number already appeared and how long ago.</p>		<p>I don't know how many tags can appear.</p>		<p>In dynamic scripting languages I'd just use an array or json object like {tag_number: [last_seen, times_seen]} and check each time tagnumber appeared, I increase times_seen by 1 and if last_seen is older than 1 second, send the times_seen to the server in order to reduce network traffic if I get spammed by the tags that report occurrences.</p>		<p>The array supposed to be short-time, long time storage is done by the MQTT server.</p>		<p>Java however has no dynamically growing arrays, I need to declare them with a fixed amount of entries. What would be the best way to do that in Java? I don't need complete examples, just a hint what kind of datatype to use, or a class? Is a buffer class object the right way here?</p>	"

Some of these assets we are able to reprogram to allow MQTT messaging with the hub, but some of these assets only have a REST API available to communicate. The only way to get the status of these assets is through polling. The authentication for their webservices is through an API-key send as parameter.</p>		<p>Is there a way to poll these assets through Azure, and get their status in Azure IoT Hub? We are not looking for ways to send messages to these devices, we only want to retrieve the status.</p>	"

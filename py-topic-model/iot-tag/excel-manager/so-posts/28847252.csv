Either remove its address from routing table (see `uip_ds6_route_rm`), this can be problematic if the IP address match a big prefix into your routing table. Or modify the source code of the `tcpip_ipv6_output` function by checking into it if the destination IP address is on the black list, and if so, simply `return` from this function."

Now last problem is after SLIP connection to border-router how can I send TCP, UDP or ICMP request from linux host machine which send packets from different address.. so my task is generate scenario of requesting node from 100 different sources. I tried scapy tool but not able to connect interface to "tun0" it shows error for tun0. Any other way to generate such traffic ?? Thanks in advance"

If you try only to get packets generated from a linux computer, I think you should ask another question on stackoverflow, with more corresponding tags. You will get better advices than mine."

I read this article:	"<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35927946/can-we-detect-non-ibeacon-beacons-on-ios">Can we detect non-iBeacon beacons on iOS?</a>"	So Basically, we can use ibeacon protocol to wake our phone up and then use our packets, so my question is that after waking up our phone how can we connect to our related app with our self-made protocol? do we have to use CoreBluetooth for our own packets? if yes does it have side effects in terms of how fast ios can detect that or even permissions? Another problem would be that how many bytes can we send to our iOS after we wake our phone up? is it still certain amount? or we can extend it? basically, can we send a 100KB file after our first ibeacon packet?</p>		<p>Thanks...</p>	"

Transferring 100K is certainly possible.</li>	</ul>		<p>Cons:</p>		<ul>	<li>No ability to detect in the background using manufacturer advertisements</li>	<li>Detecting service advertisements in the background is slow</li>	<li>Often requires a custom built beacon (unless you are using AltBeacon or Eddystone)</li>	<li>Will not let you read iBeacon -- it is blocked by Apple</li>	</ul>		<p><strong>You can try to get the best of both worlds by combining both APIs.</strong>  You do this by using two different hardware beacons (one iBeacon, one custom) or a single hardware beacon that sends out two different advertisement types.</p>		<p><strong>The main trick with these techniques is to correlate the two advertisements</strong>, as the iOS APIs are completely sandboxed from one another and no identifiers can be shared between them.  The approach I usually take is to <strong>simply use the iBeacon to wake up my app and then have it start scanning for a separate Bluetooth GATT service with a known Service UUID</strong> (either in the foreground or the background).  Once I find this, I connect to it and use it for data exchange.  Using this technique, I don't need to correlate any identifiers.  I just know that if I see a beacon with a specific ProximityUUID, then that means there is supposed to be a Bluetooth GATT service being advertised in the vicinity that I can use to do my data exchange.</p>	"

43478642,74021781,43479141,3,0,Tue Apr 18 21:59:00 EDT 2017,7883272,"Thanks @davidyoung, I just want to know if I wake up my app with iBeacon and then searching for another UUID, how long does it take to detect that non-iBeacon packet? is it in order of seconds or minutes? and for connection part, do we have to go for all of the pairing procedure? or we can have light weight connection for transferring data between our BLE and our app?"
43478642,74021824,43479141,3,0,Tue Apr 18 22:01:00 EDT 2017,7883272,"Thank you@jcaron for your comment, do you know a more efficient way to have a connection to my ios app without pairing? by saying that I mean to transfer data."
43478642,74041178,43479141,3,0,Wed Apr 19 10:44:00 EDT 2017,1461050,"After iBeacon wakeup, you can generally find the GATT service advertisement in a few seconds.  The connection is not like classic Bluetooth pairing and requires no human intervention, but it will stop beacon advertisements until the transfer is complete and it disconnects.  And yes, I would expect a 100k transfer to take tens of seconds."

For Example: <a href="https://io.adafruit.com/SOME_Value" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://io.adafruit.com/SOME_Value</a>      <strong>PLEASE HELP ME</strong></p>	"

The IO API requires a custom header field, X-AIO-Key, which contains the Adafruit IO API key. There's no way to add this header field when you enter a URL from a browser.</p>		<p>You can, however, use a command-line utility, like <code>curl</code>. The API documentation is really clear about this and shows examples, like so:</p>		<pre><code>curl -F 'value=42' -H "X-AIO-Key: {io_key}" https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/{username}/feeds/{feed_key}/data	</code></pre>		<p>Here you'd replace <code>io_key</code> with the API key, <code>username</code> with the Adafruit IO username on the account and <code>feed_key</code> with the variable you're trying to set, and <code>42</code> with the value you're setting it to.</p>	"

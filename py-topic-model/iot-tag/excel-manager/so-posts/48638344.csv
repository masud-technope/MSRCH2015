These computers should be able to submit captured images and metadata to cloud file storage once a day (e.g., Google Cloud Storage) </p>		<p>How would you organize such system in terms of security, key storage, protocols, etc? </p>		<p>I reviewed Google Cloud IOT, but this solution seems to be an overkill. maybe I'm wrong. Also, seems like passing images via such solution is too expensive.	but I like the part of device management and software upgrades.	Is it better to use Google Cloud IOT or Amazon IOT or try to develop a more simple solution on my own?</p>	"

Since you're using Raspberry Pi, they can run these APIs directly. Setup a cron job to run your script to push whatever you want into a storage bucket.</p>		<p>You'll need to setup an account on Google Cloud Platform to use the APIs. There's very good quickstart guides on this <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/quickstarts" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>	"

As indicated in the quickstart, I would recommend using Node.js for this API.</p>		<p>After that, you can integrate this API with Cloud Storage or another storage product that you see fit (Datastore, BigTable, etc.). As it was said before, you can setup a cron job for the storage operations.</p>	"

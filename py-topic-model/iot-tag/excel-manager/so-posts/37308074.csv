Now I'm trying to level up my project so I connected it to my Raspberry Pi via UART.</p>		<p>I'm able to send AT commands to make simple connections like I do on my Arduino. How can Linux "see" it like a real WLAN0 interface?</p>		<p>I'd like to use the ESP8266 as an access point to surf the web (maybe bridging the ethernet cable interface).</p>		<p>Is it possible?</p>	"

Although projects like <a href="http://hackaday.com/2015/12/09/raspberry-pi-wifi-through-sdio/" rel="nofollow">this one here</a> have figured out how to put the device into an ESP8089 mode to use it as a true WLAN interface, it requires modifying the module itself. </p>		<p>You can, however, use the device's AT API to connect to the internet through a UART and send any arbitrary data, or develop your own firmware to pass data back and forth to a server with the ESP8266 - None of these though would allow a seamless TCP connection like an actual WiFi card would, however.</p>	"

We looked for quite a bit to find an off-the-shelf one that did (to extend a maintenance port outside a housing), without success.  That means that once you've used an extension cable, you won't be able to add an OTG cable downstream of it and signal the device to switch to host mode; instead you would have to start with the OTG cable, and then use a USB "A" extension cable."

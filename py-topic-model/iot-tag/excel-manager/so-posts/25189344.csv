And it also suggested us to find additional information from Intel.</p>		<p>From Intel's web page, it's suggested to upgrade the firmware to latest version in order to get the latest fix and feature.  So, I just upgraded the firmware to v1.0.2 here.</p>		<p>After the upgrade, I can still boot into Windows, but when I attempt to execute the sketch from Visual Studio, it will cause error when accessing the pin using pinMode function.</p>		<p>After debugging the pinMode function, it was found that the error will reported in GpioSetDir: </p>		<p>pinMode(led, OUTPUT); -> _InitializePinIfNeeded(pin); -> _InitializePinIfNeeded(pin); -> _InitializePin(pin); -> Wire.begin(); -> EnableI2C(true); -> GpioSetDir(GPORT1_BIT5, 1); </p>		<p>Error was thrown after checking the return from GpioSetDir, -> ThrowError("Failed to configure I2C_CONTROLLER mux");</p>		<p>I have posted the question in WindowsOnDevices.com, someone has also tried to fallback the firmware to v1.0.0 from Intel, but the Windows cannot be booted after fallback.</p>		<p>So, it seems that Microsoft has made some changes on the firmware in order to make it work.</p>		<p>Does anyone know where I can get the v1.0.0 firmware which has been customized by Microsoft, so that I can fallback the change and continue my testing on Windows Developer Program for IoT.</p>		<p>Thanks in advance.</p>	"

Updating or flashing the Intel firmware will have you unable to use Windows, so you are stuck like all of us with a linux galileo. 	As soneone told me is possible to have the firmware on the SD you received from microsoft. If u can do an Image from that SD and post it I can have a look.</p>	"

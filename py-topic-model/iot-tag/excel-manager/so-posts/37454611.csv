I start a terminal to publish the event:</p>		<pre><code>mosquitto_pub -h 184.172.124.189 -p 1883 -u "use-token-auth" -P "token" -i d:quickstart:typeid:deviceid -t iot-2/evt/status/fmt/json -m " {\"d\": {\"temp\":34}}"	</code></pre>		<p>then I start another terminal to subscribe the event:</p>		<pre><code>mosquitto_sub -h 184.172.124.189 -p 1883 -u "use-token-auth" -P "token" -i d:quickstart:type:id -t iot-2/type/typeid/id/deviceid/evt/status/fmt/json	</code></pre>		<p>but the terminal which subscribed event can't receive the event published by the other terminal. </p>	"

Try connecting as an application and subscribe to the event.   See example in the <a href="http://iotf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart/index.html" rel="nofollow">docs.</a> </p>	"

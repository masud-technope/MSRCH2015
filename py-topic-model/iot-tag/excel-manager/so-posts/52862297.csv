I need those device names to store them as values of a custom Slot, to be able to give orders to Alexa of the type: Alexa, tell me the temperature of {deviceName}.</p>		<p>Any ideas or suggestions?</p>	"

The slot values in the live skill can be updated only after the interaction model building and successful skill certification.<br>	The Dialogflow API allows updating <a href="https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/agent/userentities" rel="nofollow noreferrer">slot values dynamically</a><br>	Hope Amazon Will add something similar soon.</p>	"

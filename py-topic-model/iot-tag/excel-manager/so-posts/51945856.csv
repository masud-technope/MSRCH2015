In this way you can then get the list of all things which are in the same group using AWS IoT SDKs. For example, by using AWS SDK for Python (Boto) you can get the list of things in an specific group using <code>list_things_in_thing_group</code> command, you can find more information <a href="https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/iot.html#IoT.Client.list_things_in_thing_group" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.	The other way would be using name/value pair for each IoT thing, say <code>name: [user]</code>. You can then filter things with this pair and list the things that created by specific user.	The third way would be saving the name of IoT devices created by each user in databases (like DynamoDB, RDS,...) and list them on UI.	Although, for all of these ways, you should consider the correct policy for users.</p>	"

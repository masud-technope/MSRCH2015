It does work fine and stable on 1300 sq feet rock house because of their mesh network functions. ZWave costs a bit more than most wifi devices like shelly but it is proven, provides mesh out of the box (if the device supports that what mostly is the case) and power consumption is less than wifi. I just go with wifi for own build devices on e.g. esp8266.</p>		<p>2000 sq feet shouldnt be a problem because of mesh (if you have enough devices spread in the house). </p>	"

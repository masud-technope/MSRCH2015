I checked the files in my PC there is no noise in them, these noise just happen in UWP. the code is as below :</p>		<pre><code>async Task PlayVoice()	    {	        MediaPlayer player = BackgroundMediaPlayer.Current;	        player.AutoPlay = true;	        player.RemoveAllEffects();	        player.MediaEnded += MediaPlayer_Loop;	        player.Volume = 1;	        player.SetUriSource(new Uri("ms-appx:///Assets/Sound/" + f[vc] + ".mp3"));	          vc++;	    }		    void MediaPlayer_Loop(MediaPlayer player, object e)	    {	        if (player == null)	            return;	        if (vc &gt;= f.Length)	            return;	        player.SetUriSource(new Uri("ms-appx:///Assets/Sound/" + f[vc] + ".mp3"));	        vc++;          	    }	</code></pre>	"

You can try to use MediaPlaybackList because <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.mediaelement.aspx" rel="nofollow">items in a MediaPlaybackList are rendered using gapless playback</a>. The code like this:</p>		<pre><code>void PlayBackList()	{	    MediaPlaybackList mediaPlaybackList;	    MediaSource mediaSource;	    MediaPlaybackItem mediaPlaybackItem;		    MediaElement mediaElement = new MediaElement();		    mediaPlaybackList = new MediaPlaybackList();		    for (vc = 0; vc &lt; f.Count; vc++)	    {	        mediaSource = MediaSource.CreateFromUri(new Uri("ms-appx:///Assets/Sound/" + f[vc] + ".wma"));	        mediaPlaybackItem = new MediaPlaybackItem(mediaSource);	        mediaPlaybackList.Items.Add(mediaPlaybackItem);	    }		    mediaPlaybackList.AutoRepeatEnabled = true;	    mediaElement.SetPlaybackSource(mediaPlaybackList);	    mediaElement.AutoPlay = true;	    mediaElement.Play();		}	</code></pre>		<p>In addition, the problem manifests itself as a loud pop or click, just before sound is output and just after sound output is stopped. This is because a PWM output of the BCM2835 CPU is being used, rather than a standard DAC. When the PWM function is activated, thereâ€™s a jump in output voltage which results in the popping sound.

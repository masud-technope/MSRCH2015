Are you looking to write python code to simulate temperature and sensor data? In that case you can refer to our python client library documentation at the link - <a href="https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/devices/libraries/python.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/devices/libraries/python.html</a> </p>		<p>If not, can you please elaborate on your question and mention clearly what are you looking for?</p>		<p>Thanks,	Loki..,</p>	"

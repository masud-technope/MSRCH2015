Each runs a web server and from my central windows server machine I display the pages from (say) <a href="http://10.1.2.253" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://10.1.2.253</a> 	I am looking for the best way to make those pages available via the internet. Using c# and asp .net but can expand my horizons. </p>	"

Then you could use arr reverse proxy to forward the request to the backend server. If you have multiple web servers, you could also modify the genrated url rewrite rule to create speical rule(with speical path in the url) to each differernt server. More details, you could refer to this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/url-rewrite-module/reverse-proxy-with-url-rewrite-v2-and-application-request-routing)."

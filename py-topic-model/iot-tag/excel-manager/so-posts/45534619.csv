Do I need to manually setup replication between postgres.	Or kaa handles this by itself, if it is so then why my second node is not in sync with the first.</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>admin-dao.properties</p>		<pre><code>jdbc_url=jdbc:postgresql://192.168.1.21:5432,192.168.1.22:5432/kaa	</code></pre>	  	  <p>sql-dao.properties</p>		<pre><code>jdbc_host_port=192.168.1.21:5432,192.168.1.22:5432	</code></pre>	</blockquote>		<p>Thanks<br/>	Rizwan</p>	"

I can read all Bacnet object "properties" such as event state, alarm etc but I need to get all alarms of all objects.</p>		<p>I know that GetAlarmSummary and GetEnrollmentSummary is deprecated and I should use GetEventInformation service but when I am browsing through objects I can find notification class objects but I do not know how they are connected with binary or analog objects. </p>		<p>I also know that Bacnet object like (binary, analog, multistateValue) has notification class number which indicates number of notification class connected to the object but I really don't know how they are reacting on each other and how is error message generated. I have noticed that objects with error has event state set to alarm but I do not know how they are cooperating with notification classes because when I try to browse notification class I only get type and priority but nothing about connected objects. Could anyone provide some sample of code that I could use or give me some points to finish this issue?</p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

But now whenever iot hub starts It first fetch old data every time (and its same every time) and then starts receiving the new data if it is being sent by simulated device.</p>		<p>My application structure is like</p>		<p><code><strong>Iot device</strong> -------> <strong>Iot hub</strong> --------> <strong>Stream Analytics</strong> ---------> <strong>Event hub</strong> ----Triggers Function----> <strong>Azure Function</strong></code></p>	"

When you start Stream Analytics you specify what date and time you want to start from. IoT Hub stores the data even after you have consumed it. If you start reading data from start, you'll get old data again."

I have one customer with 3 IOT clients who each write to their own container.</p>		<p>I use a share access policy to create a SAS URI to each container. </p>		<p>I am not using an expire data when creating the shared access policy. The generated SAS URI is copied to a config file that each of the clients use this to write blobs to the storage.</p>		<p>This works fine. On the client I create the container using</p>		<pre><code>CloudBlobContainer _container = new CloudBlobContainer(new Uri("https://myhubstorage.blob.core.windows.net/containername?sv=2015-04-05&amp;sr=c&amp;si=containername&amp;sig=xxxxx"));	</code></pre>		<p>The token above is retrieved from a config file </p>		<p>To send blobs I use</p>		<pre><code>var newBlob = _container.GetBlockBlobReference(filePath);	</code></pre>		<p>Now this works, but I'm not sure if this is the best approach. The reason is that I do not have an expiry on the shared access policy used to create the container SAS token. I don't want to distribute a new SAS token for the container each time it expires (would have to update the config file.	Also I do not want the clients to have access to the storage account key).</p>		<p>If a client is compromised I can revoke the shared access policy so the other clients will not be affected. </p>		<p>But is this the best approach to solve this regarding security? Input would be appreciated. </p>	"

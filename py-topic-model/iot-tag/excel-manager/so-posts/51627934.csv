In the raspberry I have a server that broadcast its IP using UDP broadcast. Then all my distributed sensors notice it and  connect to the Raspberry via TCP and the fun can start.</p>		<p>I added a web server to the raspberry to be able to monitor the status of my sensors and then I encountered a funny problem .. how do I discover the IP of the raspberry to be able to enter the website ?? </p>		<p>All my sensors (and the PI) have hardcoded the SSID and pass of my WiFi at home. But the thing will need to be portable. In theory I plan to set the pi as Access Point and hardcode in the sensors the SSID of the Pi and have a portable system.</p>		<p>Can a Pi on Windows IoT be set as AP ? When doing so can it's IP be forced ? </p>	"

When the Windows 10 IoT Device have access to the internet (e.g. through a wired LAN connection), it can share the Internet access with other devices connected to your device over the Wi-Fi SoftAP via <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/manage-your-device/deviceportal#iot-onboarding" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)</a>.

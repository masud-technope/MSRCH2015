The username is "user" and the password is your ThingSpeak MQTT API Key. The MQTT API Key is listed on your ThingSpeak Account > My Profile page.

On the cloudmqtt bridging form there are inputs for mqtt url, topic (I fill it with `channels/<my_channel_id>/publish/<channel_writeapi_key>`), local prefix and remote prefix. I leave prefix inputs empty."

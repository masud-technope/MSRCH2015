I would like to know good frameworks that I could use to establish bidirectional communication. I have evaluated the following frameworks.</p>		<ul>	<li>Socket.io	Easy interface to communicate. The embedded device is running a Node.js server. Stable libraries for iOS and Android. Is using websockets to communicate in a local network an overkill ?. </li>	<li>MQTT</li>	<li>ZeroMQ Super fast, however mobile frameworks available seems to be outdated</li>	</ul>	"

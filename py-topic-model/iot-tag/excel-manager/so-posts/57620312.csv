Before establishing a connection between sender and the receiver I want to do some message exchanges (for device verification) between BR and other motes(sender/ receiver).</p>		<p>I have defined a client and a server port in the border router code, just like in UDP sender/receiver motes. I have added tcpip_handler code section and a while condition for tcp_ip event.	My UDP sender sending messages but the BR does not receiving those messages.</p>	"

Make absolutely sure you have the correct UDP ports. Remember that they are the opposite for client/server (A tricky idea is to set them ALL the same...)	You should post the code here if you need more help.</p>	"

I can identify my Arduino Uno board is transmitting data from XBee S2 by seeing the tx LED, but I am not clear how to receive data on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Edison" rel="nofollow">Intel Edison</a> Arduino setup board (XBee S2 is also connected to the Intel Edison board).</p>		<p>I am not clear how the Arduino shield board for Intel Edison is supporting UART to Tx/Rx data through XBee S2. How do I actually write XBee S2 code? Is it only a serial UART communication?</p>	"

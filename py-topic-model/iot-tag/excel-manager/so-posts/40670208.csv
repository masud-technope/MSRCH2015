The scene is - 	Iâ€™ll have multiple clients(10,000s) and each of them will be publishing or subscribing to topics. But i want to restrict every client to publish and subscribe only on topics congaing there own client id - For ex- 	Topics will be- </p>		<p>my_device/<strong>12345</strong>/update</p>		<p>my_device/<strong>99998</strong>/update</p>		<p>my_device/<strong>88888</strong>/update</p>		<p>If the middle attribute is the client ID, how can i restrict clients to do a pubs only on that particular topic and no one should be able to subscribe to 	<strong>my_device/#</strong>  and hence receiving all my messages. </p>		<p>I saw ACL plugin, saw this code ( <strong>{allow, {user, "dashboard"}, subscribe, ["$SYS/#"]}</strong>. ) but there i have to define every client manually ? and what if a new user is added, how will i add one more rule automatically ? because with my understanding, this file is loaded on starting up of the broker, right ?. <strong>I want to use ACL based on some database.</strong> Can You help me with that ? </p>	"

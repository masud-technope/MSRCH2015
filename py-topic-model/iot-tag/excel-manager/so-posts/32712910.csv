Now I want to push data from arduino to kafka server and consume from kafka. Is there any kafka library for arduino?	What architecture will be suitable for scaling mqqt using apache kafka?</p>		<p>Thanks </p>	"

You can simply port <code>kafka</code> to this OS and run <code>kafka</code> client to push data to <code>apache kafka</code> server.</p>		<p>I've done it myself. To do this, you simply have to access the <code>Yun</code>'s root by doing <code>ssh</code> from the terminal.</p>		<p>Run</p>		<pre><code>$ opkg install update	</code></pre>		<p>Download the <code>kafka</code> library written in <code>Python</code> (<code>OpenWRT</code> has <code>Python</code> already installed).</p>		<p>Run <code>Python</code> <code>kafka</code> script inside your OS as client.

A tutorial is available at <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/samples/analytics/spark-integration-with-thingsboard/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://thingsboard.io/docs/samples/analytics/spark-integration-with-thingsboard/</a></p>		<p>Less complex and less scalable solution (but probably sufficient for many use cases): Program the business logic in a programming language of your choice (Python, Javascript, ...). Let the program subscribe to Thingsboard data through MQTT. Whenever there is a message with x,y,z, perform the calculation and submit p through MQTT. Documentation of Thingsboard's MQTT API: <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/reference/mqtt-api/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://thingsboard.io/docs/reference/mqtt-api/</a></p>		<p>Alternative: Process the data <em>before</em> sending it to Thingsboard. I do this using Google Apps script. The flow goes like this: Sigfox backend -> Google Apps Script -> Thingsboard gateway.</p>	"

Thanks to the input from Mikael for an alternative solution I solved it using his proposed flow.</p>		<p>thethingsnetwork --> Google Apps Script --> Thingsboard telemetry data upload</p>		<p>before I used putsreq.com to fiddle with telemetry data but the availability/reliability was not what I was expecting.</p>	"

I came across Cylon.js, but there is no documentation on hosting it on a remote server.</p>		<p>I don't want to use the Raspberry Pi or my own computer as a server, I want something more reliable like Digital Ocean or something.   </p>		<p>Can anyone please point me in the right direction?</p>	"

This is how you can implement this in a reliable way:</p>		<ul>	<li>Send temperature reading from the Pi to cloud (Azure IoT Hub)</li>	<li>Build your website and connect to IoT Hub from your website. Once done, host this website online (Azure Web Apps)</li>	</ul>		<p>You're done!</p>		<p>Resources: Connecting to IoT Hub: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/iot/get-started/" rel="nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/iot/get-started/</a> , 	<a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks</a></p>		<p>Deploying website: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/documentation/articles/web-sites-deploy/" rel="nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/documentation/articles/web-sites-deploy/</a></p>		<p>Azure free trial: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/" rel="nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/</a> </p>		<p>Note that IoT Hub can store data for a maximum of 7 days (as of today).

IoT Hub can also help in cloud-to-device messaging if you wish to do so.</p>	"

I can find multiple tutorials on reading data from sensors but what about actually controlling something remotely?  Like ideally I click an on/off button on a website and it remotely turns a motor on/off."

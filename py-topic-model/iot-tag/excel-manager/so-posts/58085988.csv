But as I started testing on newer devices, I discovered this doesn't work as smoothly as before, as now if you connect to a wifi without internet access, you get a message saying "This network has no internet access. Stay connected?". The user now has to ideally select "Dont ask again" AND select "Yes" before the network call is sent to the device.</p>		<p>It kinda sucks UX wise as if the user misses this popup, or dismisses it, the network request won't go through as Android blocks all data transfers until you specifically select "Yes" to the popup. If the user misses the popup, they can still see a notification with "This wifi has no internet access" to access the popup.</p>		<p>So, the question is : Is there a way to bypass this? Ideally something like a permission that I can ask the user before hand? I haven't found anything so far except for this issue <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42492136/force-android-to-use-wifi-network-with-no-internet">Force Android to Use Wifi network with no internet</a> that is similar, but in my case the phone doesn't go back to the mobile data, it just doesn't transfer any data between the wifi and the app. Works fine with iOS though :/</p>	"

I'm also not supposed to post the URL of the said webpage publicly, as it needs a login which I am not at liberty to release. </p>		<p>I want to interact with several features on the webpage, namely:</p>		<ul>	<li>A mouse-over drop-down menu</li>	<li>A text entering field</li>	<li>A few buttons</li>	</ul>		<p>I think that I need to do something with 'event listeners', but I'm unsure how to go about this; I have quite a lot of Python experience but not much web development knowledge.</p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

In any case what you're probably looking for is something like selenium with phantomjs. With that you could open a webpage and fill in any forms or interact with any elements on the web page."

However if you don't want a live browser doing all the things you would have to use phantomjs. That way everything will be in a script and no browser will be opened."

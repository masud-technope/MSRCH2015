In my project, I am referring to the below documentation </p>		<p><a href="https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/applications/mqtt.html#mqtt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/applications/mqtt.html#mqtt</a></p>		<p><a href="https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/devices/mqtt.html#mqtt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/devices/mqtt.html#mqtt</a></p>		<p>I have registered a device successfully on the IBM IOT using MQTT. The device is subscribing to the topic <code>iot-2/cmd/on/fmt/txt</code> for commands. There are no errors while registering the device and I am getting a message that the device is "Connected" on "IBM Watson IOT Platform" console. My first question is, how will we know that the above topic is indeed created? Is it displayed somewhere on the console? </p>		<p>In the second phase, I have created a small application with MQTT Node RED, which should be publishing commands for the device on to the topic <code>iot-2/cmd/on/fmt/txt</code>. This process does not happen. I keep getting an error message that "The topic does not match the authorized rule". I tried to change the name of the topic to <code>iot-2/type/*******/id/********/cmd/******/fmt/*******</code> (as per  <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/applications/mqtt.html#mqtt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/applications/mqtt.html#mqtt</a>). However, I keep getting the same error. Can you please let me know the valid topic format, when an application publishes commands on topic (for a device)?</p>		<p><strong>A generic question</strong>: I found that when the application publishes the command for a device, the format of the topic should be <code>iot- /type/device_type/id/device_id/cmd/command_id/fmt/format_string</code>	AND When a device subscribes to the same command, the format of the topic should be <code>iot-2/cmd/command_id/fmt/format_string</code>.	Isn't there seem to be a disconnect? When I compare it with Kafka or JMS messaging, we subscribe to the "same topic name" to which we publish, but in IBM IOT, the topic names for publishing and subscribing seem to be different. Why? </p>	"

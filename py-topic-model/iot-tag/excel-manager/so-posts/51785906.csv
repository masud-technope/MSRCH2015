I should start with</p>		<p>cf push appname  </p>		<p>Ref:	<a href="https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud/cf_index.html#cf_push" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud/cf_index.html#cf_push</a></p>		<p>appname is required and is the name of the application that you see on ibm cloud dashboard. </p>		<p>if you want to pass the path use -p option. So command should be:</p>		<pre><code>ibmcloud cf push appname -p C:\Dir1\Dir2\...	</code></pre>	"

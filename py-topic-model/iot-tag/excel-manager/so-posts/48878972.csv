On completing certain operations, the device needs to send data to Google Cloud Storage. To do so it must have an API key to authenticate itself.</p>		<p>In Android devices it could be done easily using by integrating Google Sign in Option but since my Android Thing device doesn't have any interface, Google Sign In could not be implemented in it. </p>		<p>I have gone through github project <a href="https://github.com/androidthings/weatherstation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Android Things Weather Station Sample</a> which is using Google Service Account to publish data to PubSub. To do so, it generates and imports a credential.json file into the project and somehow generates credentials from it.</p>		<p>So my question stands is, without user consent, can we use Google Service Accounts to authenticate with Google Cloud Storage? If yes, how can we generate access token from it ? If no, is there any other method to authenticate with GCS?</p>	"

Otherwise you'd need to build a mobile companion app which you use to authenticate the user. Then you would have to transfer that token to the IoT device.</p>	"

Cloud IoT Core is a bridge designed to securely manage large fleets of devices and authenticate them with your cloud project.</p>		<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/androidthings/sensorhub-cloud-iot" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SensorHub sample app</a> on GitHub, which is similar to the weather station, but uses Cloud IoT Core to authenticate and publish instead.</p>	"

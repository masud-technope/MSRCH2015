Its well documented and pretty straight forward.	But I cant find how to send data (measurement/alarm/event) using ExternalID instead of source.</p>		<p>For example, here is how POST of a measurement looks like if you know ClientID of device:</p>		<pre><code> curl -X POST \	  https://myTenant.cumulocity.com/measurement/measurements \	  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.com.nsn.cumulocity.measurement+json' \	  -H 'Authorization: Basic mytoken' \	  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \	  -d '{	    "c8y_TemperatureMeasurement": {	        "T": { 	            "value": 25,	            "unit": "C" }	        },	    "time":"2019-03-07T10:03:14.000+11:00", 	    "source": {	        "id":"1234567" }, 	    "type": "c8y_TemperatureMeasurement"	}'	</code></pre>		<p>Is there a way to replace that "source": {"id":"1234567" }, with external ID?	What would the request look like?</p>	"

Afterwards send all requests (e.g. POSTs to create measurements/alarms/events) using this retrieved sourceID.</p>		<p>This is also described in the Device SDK for HTTP here: <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/device-sdk/rest#step-1-check-if-the-device-is-already-registered" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://cumulocity.com/guides/device-sdk/rest#step-1-check-if-the-device-is-already-registered</a> .</p>		<p>Thanks for the good feedback on the documentation!</p>	"

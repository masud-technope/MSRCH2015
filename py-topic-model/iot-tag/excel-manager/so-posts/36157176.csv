I've followed this guide <a href="http://blog.oscarliang.net/raspberry-pi-arduino-connected-i2c/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.oscarliang.net/raspberry-pi-arduino-connected-i2c/</a> and I've installed and checked all the tools on the raspberry. 	- i2c and spi are enabled	- the raspi has been rebooted	- blacklist and modules have been edited and the lines about i2c have been un-commented</p>		<p>Everything looks fine, but when I run i2cdetect -y 1 I can't see anything connected to the raspberry (The raspberry is a new one so it's 1 and not 0). Are there some other commands to run to check what might be wrong? </p>	"

You need at least this :-</p>		<pre><code>#define SLAVE_ADDRESS 0x04	Wire.begin(SLAVE_ADDRESS);	</code></pre>	"

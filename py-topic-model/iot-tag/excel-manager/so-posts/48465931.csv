They call it Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer Protocol or "FIT". The only downside is that the data must be collected from their Garmin Connect site, not direct from device. It also has a pretty hefty one time fee to access the data for your application. But depending on your budget and audience, perhaps it is worth looking in to! Hope this helps.</p>		<p>You can check out the SDK for FIT here to see if it is worth your time:	<a href="https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit</a></p>		<p>More Info:	<a href="https://developer.garmin.com/garmin-connect-api/sample-data/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.garmin.com/garmin-connect-api/sample-data/</a></p>	"

It includes connecting a RaspberryPi 2 to the Internet and evaluating the possibilities of communication, that means type of connection (i guess LAN or WLAN) and how to set up the connection. Also I have to measure different criteria, like the amount of data that is transferred, the speed and so on. 	I have never worked with a RasPi before, so does anybody have a suggestion on how I can measure these parameters like amount of data and speed properly? </p>	"

This totally depends on the application. </p>		<p>Suppose the Pi is thing which transmits temperature once a second. Let´s suppose temperature value occupies 4 bytes and minimum TCP header is 20 bytes, so each  second the Pi will transmit something around 24 bytes (excluding negotiation connection, acks, errors, etc). This is a oversimplification of the problem to illustrate that RPi has nothing to do with the amount of data transmitted by IOT.</p>		<p>Now, imagine the opposite. RaspberryPi is not a thing anymore, but a central node receiving temperatures report from a bunch of nodes around a building. How much data RPi would be receiving? Depends on how many sensors are out there. RPi will also only transmits a few bytes of <code>ack</code> in this scenario.</p>	"

It would have a bunch of sensors and actuators (humidity/temp sensor, light switches, thermostats, door open/close sensors. You can measure the amount of data produced by each one of these "things" and compose a study over how much data a small, medium or large build would consume."

Now i want to stream from my raspberry pi device and the streaming output should be visible in my windows 10 pc. I am testing with two raspberry pi devices. So my goal is to display the streaming output of two devices in my windows 10 pc.     </p>		<p>I have tried few methods available over the internet neither of them work fully (simple communication sample project from windows iot samples works but very slow and the quality of the output video is not great and it breaks partially). </p>		<p>Thanks in advance</p>	"

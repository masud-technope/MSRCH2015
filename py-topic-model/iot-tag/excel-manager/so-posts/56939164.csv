Actually I'm under going an project in which I need to sense data from sensor using raspberry pi. I need to send those data to cloud database or any other database and then I should make them to see in website or mobile application? 	Is this possible? If possible, what should I learn for this long process? Please tell me the process involved?	Currently I'm learning Python (django) and mySQL what should I learn more? 	Actually this is an IOT project! 	Thank you in advance! </p>	"

You can proceed through these tutorials until sending stream data to Power Bi which is an interactive data visualization tool (supports displaying on mobile devices), so you don't need to create a website.</p>		<p>Also, you may get stuck on reading analog sensors data on Raspberry Pi. I may go deeper, but not sure you need information about the mechanical part there.</p>	"

Now as you know, MQTT has a publish subscribe model where clients subscribe to topics and other clients publish to topics. </p>		<p>So whenever a client connects to my MQTT broker and subscribes to a topic, where do I store the corresponding topic name and client? Do I create a hashmap containing topic names as keys and clients subscribed to them as values? Or is there any other way to do it?</p>		<p>Also do I store this in memory or in a database? Which one would be more efficient? </p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

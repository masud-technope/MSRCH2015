I m trying to communicate from <code>raspi 2</code> to usb composite device.(could be serial, or usb). 	From windows universal application can succesffull communicate with <code>Windows.Devices.SerialCommunication</code>  lib.	But I don't want to use universal solution. Best way for my case to use <code>Windows IoT Core Console application</code>. I could't find any way to use(<code>Windows.Devices.SerialCommunication</code>)  communicate from core console application. Can I add this reference or do you have any other lib to use at 	console application.	Thank you for your time.</p>	"

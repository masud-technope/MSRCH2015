(unoccupied message) as specified in the EEP specification.</p>		<p>-> I don't know if it is a normal behaviour what I get in my application or if there is some configuration that enable the behaviour listed above (in point 1).</p>		<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>		<p>[1] <a href="https://www.enocean.com/en/enocean_modules/ceiling-mounted-occupancy-sensor-eosc-oem/" rel="nofollow">https://www.enocean.com/en/enocean_modules/ceiling-mounted-occupancy-sensor-eosc-oem/</a></p>		<p>[2] <a href="https://www.enocean.com/en/enocean_modules/EnOcean_Occupancy_Sensor_Operational_Description_v1.1_05.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.enocean.com/en/enocean_modules/EnOcean_Occupancy_Sensor_Operational_Description_v1.1_05.pdf</a></p>		<p>[3] <a href="http://domotique-info.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/domotique-info-enocean_equipment_profiles_eep_v2.61_public.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://domotique-info.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/domotique-info-enocean_equipment_profiles_eep_v2.61_public.pdf</a></p>	"

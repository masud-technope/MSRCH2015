What I wanted to do is to collect data from various webservices(News, weather data, stock market data,..) and summarize them into the 8 channels of ThingSpeak. Is this possible? Or is there an alternative IoT platform I can use to accomplish my goal?</p>		<p>Thank you in advance for your answers and have a nice evening :)</p>	"

On an external VM the monitoring system Prometheus is running. Now i want to get the IP addresses of the gateway and the edge devices in order to insert them into the prometheus.yml </p>		<p>Is there a way to get the IP from Azure? Or should i use another way to connect Prometheus with the edge devices?</p>		<p>Thank you</p>	"

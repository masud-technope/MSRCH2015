So far I have gathered the following:</p>		<p>Option 1: Use a customized solution stack from a cloud vendor like Amazon, Azure. To quickly bootstrap, there are also consulting firms that specialize in one of these cloud solutions. </p>		<p>Option 2: Build using open-source stacks. Couple of interesting architectures are : SMACK , Lambda. </p>		<p>Any help that you could provide in pointing to the right links/books/blogs or your notes/comments from which I could derive an reference architecture will be greatly appreciated.</p>	"

You still need to develop your custom app with specific business logic to your solution requirements and you must take advantage of schema less database (NoSql) for developing such solution where data structures are unknown at this stage.</p>		<p>You can also consider following Microservices architecture for exposing APIs to be integrated with 3rd party apps.</p>	"

I don't have experience with any cloud vendor IoT offering, so cant help there.</p>		<ul>	<li><p>The SMACK stack is pretty popular, but you may not need all of it as is.</p></li>	<li><p>The key parts of that architecture are Spark for real-time analytics, Kafka for the messaging bus and Cassandra for the database layer.</p></li>	<li><p>Mesos is a management framework, you can replace with Kubernetes</p></li>	<li><p>Akka is a scale/Java language framework, not sure what your preferred language of choice is.</p></li>	</ul>	"

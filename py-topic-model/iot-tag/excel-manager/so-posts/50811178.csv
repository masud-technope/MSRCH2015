This example records the audio data and store it temporally in the device flash (1M). So due to this memory resource limitation it is hard to record a longer audio.</p>		<p>If you really want to expand the record time, it would probably need a re-architecture of this example:</p>		<ol>	<li>Change the device code to use WebScoket streaming to upload the audio to cloud continually. We have already provided a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/apis/websocket-client/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">WebSocket client library</a> for DevKit.</li>	<li>Build a Azure Web App that supports WebSocket protocol to process the audio streaming from the device, and then invoke cognitive service translator API to do the translation.</li>	<li>Send the translation result back to the device via IoT Hub C2D message.</li>	</ol>		<p>If you really want to try this solution architecture above you can refer to or try the <a href="https://github.com/DevKitExamples/DevKitChatBot" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DevKit Chat Bot</a> example. This is a more sophisticated example to demonstrate the power of the IoT DevKit to integrate with more Azure AI Services which is transmiting the continuate audio data via WebSocket streaming.</p>	"

Their help text clearly specifies that ServerFault is for "managing the hardware or software of servers, workstations, storage or networks" or "tools used for administering, monitoring, or automating these"; dism clearly falls under 'toosl used for administration". Do you have a link to your SF post so I could maybe find out what happened?"

Sorry mate, SuperUser should be able to help you. If you don't get help there, then make a post on meta.stackexchange.com describing how the community failed you and hopefully someone could finally get you pointed in the right direction."

I don't think it's electronics.se, but one I can't recall at the mo.  You can check on stackexchange.com for which site, or ask on [meta.se].  It isn't really on topic here because it's about installing an OS on an IoT device, not writing software for one."

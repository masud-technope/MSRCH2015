I am happy to pay for a licence but I'm trying to work out what I'm getting into.</p>		<p>I've checked out:</p>		<p><a href="https://opcfoundation.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://opcfoundation.org/</a> (seems my company needs to be a member to use the examples)</p>		<p><a href="https://www.matrikonopc.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.matrikonopc.com/</a> (seems the generic server toolkit is EOL)</p>		<p><a href="http://www.opcconnect.com/freesrv.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.opcconnect.com/freesrv.php</a> (looked through the options there which range from pay to even investigate to ancient or poor quality open source)</p>		<p>Are there free options to explore the possibilities and effort involved in coding up a server?</p>		<p>What are the best paid (or free) options to get the job done quickly?</p>		<p>Should we just bite the bullet and buy into an eco system?</p>	"

The reason is unknown, but most of them saying to reduce the serial port communication (hence reducing the parser effort). But that is not correct.</p>	  	  <p>If you want to build robust communication, you should turn ON the ECHO. The reason is simple, you can detect the sequence of the command/URC that’s received by the modem. Here’s the actual sequence of the illustration above (viewed from the modem’s echo):</p>		<pre><code>application&gt;AT+CMGL=4 # List all of SMS inside the ME	ME&gt; OK # There's no SMS inside the ME	ME&gt; RING # Incoming call	ME&gt; RING # Incoming call	</code></pre>	</blockquote>		<p>I am confused. I guess it should work but only if a response always goes right after a corresponding command.</p>		<p>But I couldn't find a strong point for it. Neither description of AT commands nor SIM800L datasheet does contain that statement.</p>		<p>Or maybe I just understand it in a wrong way?</p>	"

And make a Coupling between the two. Then i would like to make an App on the Rasperry Pi which will send a Notication Msg to the Gear S2.</p>		<p>Based my research the Gear S2 can be connected only a certain android phones.	Im confused hweather this could be done or not?</p>		<p>Should i use a android OS or a Tizen OS on RP3 .Can i develop an app for RP3 using the Androind Studio or Tizen Studio?If anyone has seen a similar project pls update me</p>	"

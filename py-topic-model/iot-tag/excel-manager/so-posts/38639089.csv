I2C is kinda of a serial communication bus, and you can attack multiple slave devices to an I2C bus master.</p>		<p>In your case, just share the SDA and SDL pins on the raspberry pi, those two sensor are distinguished by the unique device IDs when you discuss with them.</p>		<p>Not to mention that you have different sensors(BMP280 and TSI 2561), the manufacture ID could be just enough for differentiation. </p>		<p>We could even attach multiple I2c slave devices to the same I2c bus, the way we differentiate them is to use different address(normally 3 address pins). However, the total number of slaves would be limited, up to 8 though.</p>	"

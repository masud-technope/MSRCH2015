I've tried using:</p>		<pre><code>{	    "payload": { "message": "My custom message" }	}	</code></pre>		<p>as well as replacing <code>message</code> with <code>caption</code>, but neither seem to work. Each time, i get the default <code>ok</code> response. Does anybody know if this is possible for a Smart Home Skill? Thanks in advance for your help!</p>	"

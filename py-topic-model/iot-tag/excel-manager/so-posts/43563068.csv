However, because I want some nodes to be "nice" nodes and some nodes to be malicious, I am struggeling to understand how to modify the uip6.c file for only the malicious file. I have tried to create seperate files, but I can not import the modified uip6.c file (I also created an modified uip.h file in net/ip/uip.h). Even though I in the malicious node include the modified uip.h file and not the original, the malicious node still forward the message from the original uip6.c file. Can someone explain why or explain other possibilites to how I can implement a selective forward attack?</p>		<p>Thanks!</p>	"

If the attack_flag was 1, do not forward the packet in uip6.c. So in another program, you can set an attack_flag-variable, for instance, when the button is pressed.</p>	"

(connected via bluetooth).	<code>TI sensortag's hardware revision is 1.3.2</code> and <code>software revision is 1.2.1</code>	When I enable all sensors , and I want to read values from them, I got only Temperature and accelerometer values. Looks like that sensortag resets after that and then starts from beggining.</p>		<p>I used BlueZ tool also, and I can read values from any sensor.	I can read with Kura also, but I cann't read them all together. I tried with mobile app to read from sensortag, and it works good.	I am using Kura 2.1.	Does anybody have idea what could go wrong? ( Collegue of mine is getting all values good, with same hardware and software setup. I tried his deployment package, but I had same result.)	Could it be something with Raspberry Pi bluetooth module?</p>		<p>I am using <strong>org.eclipse.kura.example.ble.tisensortag</strong> example.</p>		<p>Kura web panel setup :</p>		<p><a href="http://prntscr.com/ek868g" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://prntscr.com/ek868g</a></p>		<p>Terminal log : </p>		<p><a href="http://prntscr.com/ek86hp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://prntscr.com/ek86hp</a></p>	"

You can do it by yourself on two ways :	- In first case, you will need http://www.ti.com/tool/CC-DEVPACK-DEBUG	- In second case, (I don't know which programming language you use), but it can be that register addresses aren't maped good, maybe you are reading from wrong registers."

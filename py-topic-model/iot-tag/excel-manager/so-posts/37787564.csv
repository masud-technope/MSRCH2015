Since you mentioned Azure Mobile Services, you can use Azure Mobile Services to register the device.  However, I suspect you are using the newer Azure Mobile Apps (which is different!)

The "backend" in this case would be the Azure Mobile Apps and you can send to the notification hub (and hence to your device) using the .NET Notification Hubs SDK or REST.  The "client" would be your Android IoT device."

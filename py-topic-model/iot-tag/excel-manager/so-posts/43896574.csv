Need to determine that devices access only certain sites? This lock can be made	By WSO2 IOT, EMM, or by android or in the android browser?	I need to leave the smarphones with restricted access, accessing only the defined sites</p>	"

The user might be still able to use a proxy service or a tunnel to browse websites."

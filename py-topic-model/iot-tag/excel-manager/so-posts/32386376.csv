I set the platform to "Ethernet IoT Starter Kit" and compiled the hello-world blinking LED example without any compiler errors. </p>		<p>After I copied the bin file on the mbed flash drive I instantly found the fail.txt file on the flashdrive. Even before pressing the button to flash the binary. The failed.txt file contains "INVALID BINARY NVIC".</p>		<p>I also tried it with "FRDM-K64F" instead of "InternetOfThingsKit" platform.</p>	"

Starting with Yosemite MAC has a problem to mount the device in the right way and end up with a scrambled bin file which is then rejected by the bootloader. I still have the problem with OSX 10.10.5. Solution is to use a Linux machine or Virtual Box with a Linux OS.</p>		<p><a href="http://embedxcode.weebly.com/blog/mbed-on-mac-os-x-yosemite-bug-and-time-to-innocence" rel="nofollow">http://embedxcode.weebly.com/blog/mbed-on-mac-os-x-yosemite-bug-and-time-to-innocence</a></p>	"

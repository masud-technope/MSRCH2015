At step 3 of section 'Create IoT Platform' I should go to menu Security and then Connection Security to choose TLS option. However, I am not able to retrieve 'Connection Security' (and also 'Devices' I'm not able to find). Is there anyone who could give me an indication where to retrieve this option?</p>	"

What you need is actually on the IoT Service. You can either launch it from the IBM Cloud console by using the Launch button after you select the IoT Service, or you can login via https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/"

I am currently working on <strong>iCT220</strong> on which I want to implement IOT project. In this project, I will be sending some bytes (may be 400-1000 bytes) of data to the broker (server).</p>		<p>There are lots of source codes for the library available in the internet, but all make use of Linux or Windows socket libraries, where as Ingenico's devices come with proprietary libraries.</p>		<p>Have anyone implemented similar project on the same devices? Can anyone guide me to the process of implementation?</p>		<p>Thanks in advance,	Pankaj</p>	"

I had a look at several client libraries and it looks that dependencies come mostly from IP stack, so there's very little to be implemented to have it running.	You should expect the proprietary OS issues to be thing of the past in short time - newer terminal lines are based on linux.</p>	"

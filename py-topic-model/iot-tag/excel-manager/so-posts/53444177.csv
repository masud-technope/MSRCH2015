So unknowingly doing this, the board lost it's calibration. I tried to calibrate the board using <strong>MauiMETA_exe_v9.1724.25.00 tool</strong> as per their guidance and the calibration is also successful. So I hope both the calibration and OS also downloaded now to the ROM. </p>		<p>Eventually I tried to start the board, the monitor shows no signal. Looks like board is <strong>not booting</strong> up, both the red and green lights are ON. Somebody please advise what might be the problem???</p>	"

So I need to run Windows IOT Core on the Raspberry Pi 3 (if it was up to me I'd use raspbian or some other flavor of linux, but it's not up to me) and I need to run it at a school who's network I don't have access to. Is there any way of running IOT on raspberry Pi without an internet connection. I had read somewhere that I could buy a router (and even though there was no internet connected to it) I could run ethernet from the router to my laptop and another from the router to the raspberry pi and ssh into the pi from my laptop. Is this true? and how would I go about ssh-ing into the pi? OR is there a better/alternative solution to running IOT with no internet?</p>	"

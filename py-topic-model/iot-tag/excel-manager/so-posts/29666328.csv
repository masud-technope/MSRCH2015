This sensor should be connected to internet in order to send data to server. The sensor has wi-fi module which will take care of this communication.</p>		<p><strong>What I want to achieve :</strong></p>		<p>User should be able to set his own wi-fi username/password in the sensor device. for this, I am thinking of android app which can connect to sensor and send username/password to it. But I am not aware of standard procedures. </p>		<p><strong>Question:</strong>	Can anyone tell me how do we ensure that end user can easily setup his own sensor by passing required data to it ? what is the standard procedure to achieve this ?</p>	"

A computer, android, any device can connect to this AP and configure the sensor. Chromecast do something similar to this. It broadcasts so Android device can detect it, than it follows a Android app flow that should configure it to the WiFi desired and finally, it can be found at local WiFi.</p>		<p>Seems the best approach to me.</p>	"

But if any field is not present IoT throws: <strong>Error while evaluating where clause: Undefined result</strong></p>		<p>For example here is expected message: </p>		<pre><code>{	    field_1: 'value1',	    field_2: 'value2',	    field_3: 'value3'	}	</code></pre>		<p>SQL rule for Valid Data:</p>		<p><code>select field_1 as x, field_2 as y, field_3 as z WHERE cast(field_1 as Int) &gt; 10</code></p>		<p>SQL rule for Invalid Data:</p>		<p><code>select field_1 as x, field_2 as y, field_3 as z WHERE NOT ( cast(field_1 as Int) &gt; 10 )</code></p>		<p>If any field is missing as shown below, above rule won't work.</p>		<pre><code>{	    field_1: 'value1',	    field_2: 'value2'	}	</code></pre>		<p>What is the way to detect whether a certain field is present or not?</p>	"

For example you can do something like that in the WHERE statement:</p>		<pre><code>SELECT field_1 as x, field_2 as y, field_3 as z FROM 'topic' WHERE IsUndefined(field_1) = False AND IsUndefined(field_2) = False AND IsUndefined(field_3) = False	</code></pre>		<p>With this statement the rule will no trigger if one of the 3 fields is missing.</p>	"

Please suggest</p>		<p>Any supportive studies either ways. Seems like a broad question .. but</p>	"

Also i think it would depend on the hardware of the device; like how much secure it is from that point of view</p>	"

So if you're talking about existing devices, then the answer to your question is no.</p>		<p>That doesn't mean that IoT is inherently insecure or privacy-invading, just that the vast majority of devices have chosen to make it so, undermining trust in all of it - look at all the stuff that Google and Amazon have been trying to get away with.</p>		<p>You can of course build your own, but when you say "once we decide to move on", it suggests that you want these devices to operate peer-to-peer without a cloud connection (i.e. when there's nobody paying for servers). This is entirely possible using things like tor and signal protocols, but it's not easy, and you're unlikely to find a comprehensive answer on Stack Overflow. You're going to need some good privacy- and security-aware developers to make that work, and they won't be cheap.</p>	"

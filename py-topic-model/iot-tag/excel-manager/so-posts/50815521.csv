Without Z-Wave devices, there's no use for the Z-Wave protocol. </p>		<p>Until very recently, if you wanted to create your own Z-Wave device, you had to spend about $3,000 and sign a non-disclosure agreement to get access to the documentation and tools, and your device had to be certified before you could sell it. </p>		<p>The <a href="https://z-uno.z-wave.me/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Zuno</a> is a recent DIY Z-Wave board that enables you to create a device that speaks Z-Wave. Boards like the Razberry don't give you that capability.

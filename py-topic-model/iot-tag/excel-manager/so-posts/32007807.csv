What is the size of CoAP packet?</strong><br>	(I know there is 4 byte fixed header, but what is the maximum size limit including header, option and payload?)</p>		<p><strong>Q-2. Is there any concept for Keep Alive like MQTT?</strong><br>	(It works on UDP for how much time it keeps open the connection, is there any default time or it keeps open every time when we send packet?)</p>		<p><strong>Q-3. Can we use CoAP with TCP?</strong><br>	(Main problem with it CoAP is it works on UDP, is there any concept like MQTT QoS? Let's say a sensor publishes some data every one second, if subscriber goes offline, is there any surety in CoAP that subscriber will get all the data when it come online?)</p>		<p><strong>Q-4. What is the duration of connection?</strong><br>	(CoAP supports publish/subscribe architecture, may be it needs connection open all the time, is it possible with CoAP whether it is based on UDP.)</p>		<p><strong>Q-5. How does it discover the resources?</strong><br>	(I have one gateway and 5 sensors, how will these sensors connect to the gateway? Will the gateway find these sensors? Or will sensors find the gateway?)</p>		<p><strong>Q-5. How does sensor register with gateway?</strong></p>		<p>Please help me, I really need answer. I'm all new for these kind of things and suggest me something for implementation point of view.</p>		<p>Thanks.</p>	"

If nothing is known about the size of the headers, good upper bounds are 1152 bytes for the message size and 1024 bytes for the payload size;</li>	<li>or less to avoid adaptation layer fragmentation (60-80 bytes for 6LoWPAN networks);</li>	</ul></li>	<li>if you need to transfer larger payloads, this <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-block-17" rel="nofollow">IETF draft</a> extends core CoAP with new options for transferring multiple blocks of information from a resource representation in multiple request-response pair (so you can transfer more than 64KiB per message).</li>	</ul></li>	<li><p>I never used MQTT, in any case CoAP is connectionless, requests and responses are exchanged asynchronously over UDP or DTLS.

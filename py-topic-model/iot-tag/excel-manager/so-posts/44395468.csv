Both devices transfer data on a specified port, and are currently up and running very well. That being said i would like to add up my computer (random pc) to transferâ€‹ and receive data with both devices. 	Note that both devices are programmed by some other third party and i cannot modify nothing, but both contain options for data transfer to a second ip address.	Since receiving data is MAYBE less complicated as the two devices are capable of transmitting/receiving  I would like to  know how i can transfer data from my pc to these two devices? </p>		<p>Any clue? </p>		<p>Sorry for the long post and my English since it's not my native language. </p>	"

The two devices mentioned in the post simply transfer/receive data via Public ip addresses nothing more. And the transfer protocol is udp, sorry for not mentioning it."

Services are application layers.  A Socket is a connection layers.  So a connection has a client and server also.  The server is a slave device and is a listener.  The client is a master device that connects to a listener (server).  The two devices are server-listeners."

You didn't specify what protocol the devices arre using.  Is it a Web application or TCP?  msdn : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w89fhyex(v=vs.110).aspx"

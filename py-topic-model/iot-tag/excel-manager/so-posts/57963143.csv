57963143,57963143,null,1,1,Mon Sep 16 19:16:00 EDT 2019,10066623,"<p>In a pursuit to use a low cost, less pin micro-controller, I have ended up with the PIC series PIC10F200/202/204/206 as a prospective choice. My use cases for them involve using just one or two pins to control external peripherals like DC motors, LEDs. And using at most one OR two sensors for input. I have some experience with Arduino but no experience with PIC series at all.</p>		<p>Looking at the projects over the internet, it seems that the higher series of PIC micro-controllers like PIC16*, PIC18* can be programmed in both C and assembly language. But for the series - PIC10F200/202/204/206, I see programs being developed only in assembly language. I have read somewhere that it is due to less memory available in the PIC10F* micro-controllers. I can program in C, but have no idea about assembly language. It seems difficult to learn as well, and hence could be a dead end for me for now if assembly is the only language I can use.</p>		<p>So, I want to ask, is it NOT possible to program these specific microcontrollers using C language? Is it really a constraint that I need to use assembly language only? </p>		<p>OR </p>		<p>Is it just my misunderstanding and the PIC10F* series can be programmed with C language just like PIC16* and PIC18* series.</p>		<p>Please let me know if you need any further information from my side before answering this.</p>		<p>Thanks,</p>		<p>Anurag</p>	"

Just look at the specs on the parts you mentioned.  384 bytes of flash 16 bytes of ram.  That is tough for assembly much less C you would struggle to bootstrap in that.   The pic instruction set is not C compiler friendly, not that microchip didnt do a good job with their backend."

If such is the case, I think I should step up to either a higher PIC series or with a new MCU in the same PIC series.

It seems like the client doesnt open.	If it helps, the same raspberry pi 3 model B is sending data to the azure iot hub to be used in the stream analytics and then shown in power bi. That data is been sending in to a different hub, but i dont know if that is causing trouble with the hub im trying to use. That data ys using languague phyton.</p>		<p>Im using this tutorial, azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/get_started/java-run-sample.md and, again, in a machine with windows 10 works fine.</p>		<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tbHUn.png" alt="amqps"></p>		<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/84Upd.png" alt="mqtt"></p>	"

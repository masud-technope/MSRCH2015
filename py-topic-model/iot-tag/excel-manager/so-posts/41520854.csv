You need to create some "wrapper" classes around your native C++ APIs, using pInvoke.</p>		<p>Microsoft has an official github repository fork of OpenCV, <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/opencv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/Microsoft/opencv</a>, follow the tutorial here to use it with Windows IoT Core <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/samples/opencv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/samples/opencv</a></p>		<p>Also, notice that <a href="http://www.emgu.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow noreferrer">EMGU CV</a> is introducing support for UWP in the latest revision, however, you'll need to get the commercial license for that.</p>	"

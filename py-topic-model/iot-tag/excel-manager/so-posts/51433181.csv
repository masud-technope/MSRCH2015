To be specific, trying to build to something like this : <a href="https://my.artik.cloud/devices" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://my.artik.cloud/devices</a></p>		<p>A cloud platform to integrate with various device types. The minimum requirement is able to add new device integration without changing the code. Any pointers on how to achieve this ?</p>	"

51433181,89865005,51433765,3,0,Fri Jul 20 17:06:00 EDT 2018,2756547,"Well, workaround is to copy/paste an `IntegrationRequestMappingHandlerMapping` from `5.1` to your own project and register it as a `HttpContextUtils.HANDLER_MAPPING_BEAN_NAME` bean. This way your one will have a precedence over one registered by Framework."

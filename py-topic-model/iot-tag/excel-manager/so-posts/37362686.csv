But I would like to be able to reach it without relying on something.</p>		<p>I was thinking that my IOT device could ,on every start, write in a database its IP adress so my script on the server knows its ip. </p>		<p>The problem is that the IP will correspond to my hotspot IP. I am missing the connection part "hotspot -->IOT device".</p>		<p>For example I would like to be able to connect my IOT device to my mobile phone in hotspot mode.</p>	"

MQTT also removes the need for the server application itself to need to connect to the clients. MQTT uses a concept called publish/subscribe with pre-agreed 'topics' - the client will subscribe to a 'command' topic, the server app publishes commands to that topic and the broker handles forwarding the command to the device. Incoming data from the device is published to another topic and the server application subscribes to that topic, the broker forwards the published data. You can try pub/sub example (using a browser, but real devices can also connect to the same server) using e.g. <a href="http://m2m.demos.ibm.com/utilities.html" rel="nofollow">http://m2m.demos.ibm.com/utilities.html</a></p>	"

You could also as a short-term solution use the public mqtt server, your device connects to that and subscribes to your chosen command topic. then in your web server you can use e.g. paho browser/javascript client to publish to the command topic.There are other more homegrown ways for handling a single device but as soon as you want to scale up these will get more complex. If all you ever want is a single device then a simple python socket server will probably suffice, make your web server connect to that to send a message. HTH Barny"

I exported the provider project into a jar and wanted to deploy it into concierge/felix in both I was able to manage the lifecycle of the bundle (install/start/stop..) the issue is that the commands that I created I never can see them in there, but in eclipse the gogo commands are present and I can see/execute them.</p>		<p>I don't know how to figure this out, it says gogo commandNotFoundException.	Is these 2 options have any imact ? (runfw+runee).</p>		<p>I developed on windows and they are set on : 	runfw : org.eclipse.osgi and runee : JavaSE-1.8	and once I deploy this in linux, Felix/concierge container on a compact 1 Embedded Java SE it does the issue.	Thanks for your help!</p>	"

As I'm running my bundles inside concierge and I've installed the gogo bundles. the issue is that there was 2 shells running : the gogo one and the concierge one. Once I stopped the concierge shell I was able to see my commands when I run the help.		Thanks."

Now I am trying to input some parameters into the python file without stopping or rerunning the python script. 	How can I do that with Node-Red?</p>		<p>I tried to use the flow as shown below.	MQTT -> Exec node (call python script and appending parameters at the back.)<br>	But this reruns the script each time when a new msg payload come in.</p>		<p>My ML python script is trying to get inputs from stdin. Is there any way to do this via passing it into stdin? I do not want to use MQTT subscribe in my python script.</p>	"

I tried to create a python command to read the input using raw_input and print out the input. but nothing is showing on my node-red output. the command i input in deamon is sudo. Arguments is python -u /home/pi/test/testing.py. Do you have a simple example to show me?"

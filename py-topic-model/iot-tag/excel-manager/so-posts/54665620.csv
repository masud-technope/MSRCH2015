It sent temperature data &amp; turned on/off bulb correctly. Now I have connected another raspberry pi with different device ID. Actually I have enrolled a new raspberry pi device to management console. They have two different names &amp; ids. But when I run both testAgents no one works correctly. No one sends temperature data &amp; switches on/off the bulb. What they only do is connecting to the broker &amp; disconnecting from the broker &amp; nothing else. When first one is connected to broker 2nd one gets disconnected. When second one is connected 1st one gets disconnected. What can I do???????????? 	any help please....</p>	"

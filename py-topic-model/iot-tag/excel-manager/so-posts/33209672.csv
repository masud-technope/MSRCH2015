I wrote a blocking publisher and a client subscriber. I created two threads of the subscribing client with different client ids. When I publish one message with QoS 2, both the clients receive the message. I am expecting exactly one client to receive the message. Is my expectation wrong?</p>		<p>I felt I didn't program to the API correctly and wanted to troubleshoot with mosquitto_pub and mosquitto_sub. Same result. Both the subscribers received the message. Please check the screenshot here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/G5a4D" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/G5a4D</a></p>		<p>I am pretty sure that I am doing something wrong but I am not able to pinpoint it. All mosquitto.conf properties are set to default. Any help would be appreciated. I have exhausted half a day on this already. :(</p>	"

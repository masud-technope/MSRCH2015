Then we are exploring via GitHub and we found partially deployment can be done via dev machine and Azure. </p>		<p>Can Azure Remote Monitoring IoT Suite preconfigured solution running on local machine fully (no Azure till it's fully working)? </p>		<p>The reason we asked this due to IoT Azure is a bit pricy for development/demo around $200/month to operate even after we are configured with basic service as some Azure component can't downgrade to the free one once setup as higher service.</p>		<p>Thanks for the input.</p>	"

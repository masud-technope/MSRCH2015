Eventdata will be sent to one Event hub and Stream analytics will read from there. After processing Stream analytics will write it to different event hub in certain partition. </p>		<pre><code>SenderEventHub[Partition-1]--&gt;Stream Analytics --&gt;ReciverEventHub[Partition-2]	</code></pre>		<p>Receiving part is normally taking <code>60-150s</code> on receive method which should not be the case here. I am not sure what is going under wrapper and where its taking.

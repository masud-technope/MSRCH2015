The device has RTOS os (not the aws enhanced one) and a propriety ble module.	Our IOT device has an accompanying mobile app which has both an internet connection and ble module.</p>		<p>We now support the distribution of firmware updates via the mobile app running on a phone, that serves as a bridge to the IOT device.</p>		<p>Is there a simple way to use leverage AWS IOT for the purpose of distributing the firmware without changing anything on the IOT device, and if yes what are the benefits of using AWS IOT in this scenario? </p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

Apologies if this question seems too obvious or generic.</p>		<p>I am working on a school project, which involves streaming data from hundreds (maybe thousands) of Iot sensors, storing said data on a database, then retrieving that data for display on a web-based UI.</p>		<p>Things to note are:</p>		<ol>	<li>fault-tolerance and the ability to accept incomplete data entries</li>	<li>the database has to have the ability to load and query data by stream</li>	</ol>		<p><br></p>		<p>I've looked around on Google for some ideas on how to build an architecture that can support these requirements. Here's what I have in mind:</p>		<ol>	<li>Sensor data is collected by <i>FluentD</i> and converted into a stream</li>	<li><i>Apache Spark</i> manages a cluster of <i>MongoDB</i> servers	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. the <i>MongoDB</i> servers are connected to the same storage	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. <i>Spark</i> will handle fault-tolerance and load balancing between <i>MongoDB</i> servers</li>	<li><i>BigQuery</i> will be used for handling queries from UI/web application.</li>	</ol>		<p>My current idea of a IoT streaming architecture :	<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gsC0B.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gsC0B.png" alt="enter image description here"></a>	<br>	The question now is whether this architecture is feasible, or whether it would work at all. I'm open to any ideas and suggestions.</p>		<p>Thanks in advance!</p>	"

And in SO we ask questions about specific issues rather than getting opinions. You could google those different technologies and stick to one too."

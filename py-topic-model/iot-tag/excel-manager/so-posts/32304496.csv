Most recent changes have a higher timestamp.</li>	<li><code>kura/dpa.properties</code> this files contains a list of deployed <em>Deployment Packages</em>, installed through web-ui or DEPLOY-V1 cloudlet. </li>	<li><code>*.dp</code> the actual <em>Deployment Packages</em> installed.</li>	<li>If you manually added jars or edited start scripts, you must copy/edit them again</li>	</ul>		<p>Depending on how you upgrade, you may or may not have the previous installation deleted. Shell script installer for example changes <code>/opt/eclipse/kura/</code> symlink to the version it installs, without deleting the old one.</p>	"

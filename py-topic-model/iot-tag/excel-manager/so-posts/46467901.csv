The standard way is to send a timestamp and with some key-value-pairs like so:</p>		<pre><code>{"ts":1451649600512, "values":{"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"}}	</code></pre>		<p>My problem is, that I need to process up to 100 acceleration measurements per second and I dont want to send a http post for every x-y-z value-package. Is there a way to send one json body with, lets say, 100 timestamps with corresponding measurements?</p>		<p>I tried it:</p>		<pre><code>{	"ts": 1508695100,	"values": {	    "key1": 34,	    "key2": 26	},	"ts": 1508695200,	"values": {	    "key1": 38,	    "key2": 29	}	</code></pre>		<p>}</p>		<p>There is no error message when pushing this json to ThingsBoard with curl, but only the last timestamp-value-block seems to be recognized by ThingsBoard.</p>		<p>Any suggestions on how to to solve my problem?</p>	"

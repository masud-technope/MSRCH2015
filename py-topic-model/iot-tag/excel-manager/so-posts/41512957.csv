For a start, I am trying to make a simple wifi controlled relay with NodeMCU as a UDP server. The problem is, after running for several hours, I can't make a connection to the board. I tried pinging the board using the ping command, but got no response. If I restart the board, it works again. Any ideas why? Thanks.</p>		<p>Here is my Lua script: </p>		<pre><code>pin_relay = 1	port = 1310	state = 0	gpio.mode(pin_relay, gpio.OUTPUT)	gpio.write(pin_relay, gpio.HIGH)		wifi.setmode(wifi.STATION)	wifi.sta.config("SSID", "password")	wifi.sta.connect()	wifi.sta.setip({ip="192.168.1.200",netmask="255.255.255.0",gateway="192.168.1.1"})	print("ESP8266 mode is: " .. wifi.getmode())	print("The module MAC address is: " .. wifi.ap.getmac())	print("Config done, IP is "..wifi.sta.getip())		srv=net.createServer(net.UDP)	srv:on("receive", function(srv, pl)	   if pl=="switch" then 	    if state == 0 then	        gpio.write(pin_relay,gpio.LOW)	        state = 1	    elseif state == 1 then	        gpio.write(pin_relay,gpio.HIGH)	        state = 0	    end	   end	end)	srv:listen(port)	</code></pre>	"

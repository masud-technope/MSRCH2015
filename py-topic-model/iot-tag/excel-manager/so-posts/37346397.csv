I have the samples from IoT working and the sensor receiving data but connecting the two isn't really working out.</p>		<p>I tried merging the code from the sensor in the sample from <strong>Azure IoT hub</strong> (this one: <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http.c" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http.c</a>)</p>		<p>But this file has a complex make file and I cant seem to include my <strong>MRAA</strong> pin library (<a href="https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa" rel="nofollow">Low Level Skeleton Library for IO Communication on GNU/Linux platforms</a>). </p>		<p>Is there a way to include the MRAA library or a simple IoT sample I can easily modify without this huge and complex make file.</p>	"

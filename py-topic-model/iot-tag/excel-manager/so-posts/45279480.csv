How can we receive data from a particular device?</p>		<p>For example, if we have <code>device001</code> and <code>device002</code>, I want to receive telemetry from IoT hub for only <code>device001</code> and telemetry from IoT hub for only <code>device002</code> using Event Hub, or is there any other way?</p>	"

Further filtering to device level will have to happen in your code. If you have many devices per partition, you might want to have some intermediate service that filters events before they get to the mobile device (e.g. a web app with SignalR).</p>	"

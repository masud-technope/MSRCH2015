I suggest to go with SDK because it's easy to manage compare to API calls. Based on the Best practice document of IoTConnect on <a href="https://help.iotconnect.io" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://help.iotconnect.io</a>, They are recommended to use SDK. </p>		<p>Currently they provide limited language in UI SDK, so please check your development language is listed on the document for SDK.</p>	"

If APIs owner changes the baseUrl pattern or input or output params then it won't work. You need to set again baseUrl and check one by one parmas to get the result</p>		<p>In SDK, you just need to update the SDK library and check the documentation for updated params only. It will easy to reconfigure compare to APIs.</p>		<p>I suggest go ahead with SDK to ease of use and more scalable. </p>	"

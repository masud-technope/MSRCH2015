Is it possible to create both a client and a server in the same Arduino? Also is there any method by which it is possible to control and monitor an Arduino at the same time?</p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

For eg. analog values from a sensor connected to Arduino should be visible on a web page hosted by the web server, at the same time can I use it to obtain data from the webserver for eg. to control an LED connected to the arduino using a switch on that web page? Is there an example available? @Alphonsos_Pangas"

Then, upon receiving a request, the server should examine the page requested, and if it is the page "/turnon" it would turn on the switch. It is too late right now for me to post code, I 'll do it tomorrow if I remember to."

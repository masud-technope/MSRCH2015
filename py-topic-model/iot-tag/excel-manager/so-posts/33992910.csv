All is working fine. </p>		<p>I have few parameters in API App, which i want to get from users who is using Connector. i.e. Connection String, Authorization Token. Like, if we use SMTP Connector, it will ask user to add Server Name, Port, etc.</p>		<p>Any idea how to give user interface in API App (for Connector use)? Feel free to ask me if you are confused about my question.</p>		<p><strong><em>SOLUTION:</em></strong></p>		<p>Finally i did it with Swagger UI. Hope it helps someone.</p>	"

There is no UI for any part of Logic / API Apps. It is an API, it expects a JSON message with those details in. You need to build a front end that will send the relevant data into the Logic / API App."

There should be particular element/or app for that, that's what my questions is."

33992910,55747576,33993746,3,0,Mon Nov 30 10:07:00 EST 2015,5352886,"1. I have create API app. 2. I will publish it and use it as Logic App connector. 3. while adding connector as action i want to give UI to user from where user can add some connection data. 4. Ultimately user will be from my organization only but i am trying to create dynamic connector which i can use for multiple logic apps."

33992910,55748268,33993746,3,0,Mon Nov 30 10:25:00 EST 2015,5352886,"Basically i am creating logic app CONNECTOR (which can be achieve through API app only). The API App/CONNECTOR is ready but it has two field connection & password. Now, i want this two filed value from user. Like, if you add SMTP Connector to Logic App, it will ask you for few configuraiton i.e. server address, port, user,pass. hope you got it. it's pretty straight forward."

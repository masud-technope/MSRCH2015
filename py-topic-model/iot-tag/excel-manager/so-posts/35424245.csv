It showed where I had entered bad information.  Y'all might want to review the docs supplied to make sure that there is enough information available for a future reader to put all the pieces together."

After seeing your recipe, I realized that I was supplying "use-auth-token" as my userid in the Basic Authentication which is, of course, very wrong.  I'd like to suggest that the pages found as reference in my original post be updated with the instructions you supplied in your screen shot.  Again, MANY thanks."

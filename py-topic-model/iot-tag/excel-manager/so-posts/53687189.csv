So I removed them and installed them directly from localhost deploy , by going to "Manage Palette" from the menu and I searched for GrovePi and installed the 3 nodes that were available. The `node-red-grovepi-nodes` worked but the `node-red-contrib-grovepi` doesn't, and that is the one I need. It says [object Object] and "board-config""

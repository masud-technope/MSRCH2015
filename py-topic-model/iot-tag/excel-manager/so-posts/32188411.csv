The GpioPinDriveMode enumeration includes input pullup and input pulldown as shown <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows.devices.gpio.gpiopindrivemode.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  My concern is that the Visual Studio 2015 intellisense is showing a "not supported" tool tip when using the pullup or pulldown enumeration.  Is it in fact not supported ?</p>	"

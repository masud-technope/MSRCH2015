I want to be able to send control commands from my iPhone to the Pi and have the Pi respond with a status update.</p>		<p>The Pi is running Node-RED and can both send and receive both events and commands to IBM IoT Foundation (verified from a Bluemix Node-RED application).</p>		<p>The iPhone Swift app is using <a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/MQTTClient" rel="nofollow">https://cocoapods.org/pods/MQTTClient</a> (Note - does not specifically list IBM IoT as a tested platform).</p>		<p>From the Swift app, I have successfully connected to IBM IoTF and sent <strong>events</strong> which the Pi receives.  I have also successfully subscribed to command topics in the form <code>"iot-2/cmd/streamStarted/fmt/json"</code>, but never receive a message.  If I try to publish a command in the form <code>"iot-2/cmd/startStream/fmt/json"</code> or subscribe to events in the form <code>"iot-2/evt/streamStarted/fmt/json"</code> or <code>"iot-2/type/myPi/id/&lt;myPiID&gt;/evt/streamStarted/fmt/json"</code>, the connection immediately closes.</p>		<p>The bottom line is that I need to get a status message from the Pi to the iPhone in some way.  I don't really care if it is an event, a command or something else.  I have been successful doing this with <code>test.mosquitto.org</code>, events but not IoT Foundation. </p>	"

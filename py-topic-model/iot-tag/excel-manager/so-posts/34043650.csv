I developed the backend system using nodejs, then I will develop Mobile app that will use google library to publish/subscribe.</p>		<p>The problem that I face now is that. Does google have any C/C++ Library for contacting PubSub/googlecloud API or not, and if not, is there any alternative way to keep embedded devices (programmed in C/C++) updated with mobile applications actions.</p>		<p>Note: I need real-time control between mobile app and embedded device.</p>		<p>Thanks</p>	"

If you can run Go or Java on your embedded device (both a lot less common than C/C++ on embedded devices, and usually only supported if you stretch the definition of "embedded"), you can have a fully-supported client library.</p>	"

Now I want to send data captured by my device to my back-end server, which is a Django server. Also sending data should be done real-time. I am using a GSM module to connect the device to internet. The Django server is in my local PC. </p>		<p>How can I establish the connection between my Raspberry Pi and Django server?</p>	"

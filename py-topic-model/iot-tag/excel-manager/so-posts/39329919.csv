It's either Pi and PC and connected to the same network, or you directly connect Pi to PC with an Ethernet cable.</p>		<p>Check your Remote server settings, chances are you're not enabling the "Windows IoT Remote Server". </p>		<p>I've seen it myself several times.</p>		<p>Log in to the admin web page, on the very bottom of the left tabs, go to "Remote", and check if your "Enable Windows IoT Remote Server" checkbox is really checked.</p>		<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ZBTR.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ZBTR.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>	"

Make sure the Ip is not included in the lower box of win IOT remote client</p>		<p>There are also other steps you might need to take including </p>		<ul>	<li>Using Powershell to add the device as a trusted device	<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/docs/powershell" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/docs/powershell</a></li>	<li>As well as adding taking the step in the comment above.</li>	</ul>		<p>Good luck - Windows IOT on pi has a pit of a learning curve </p>	"

Every Video or post regarding this situation I have found is either from 2015, when it came out or not related to my problem.	Has anybody succeeded in maybe stripping it of some functions (like Cortana) so that it would boot quicker?	I'm on a Raspberry Pi 3 using Win10 IoTCore Build 10.0.15063.0.	I also tried building my own image (as described here <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/hardware/commercialize/manufacture/iot/set-up-your-pc-to-customize-iot-core" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/hardware/commercialize/manufacture/iot/set-up-your-pc-to-customize-iot-core</a>), but to no avail.</p>	"

I'll replace it with the Samsung Card and try again.	Since I want to use an App with a GUI, headless mode is not an option. I uninstalled the IoTCoreDefaultApp and set my own Test App (one button, one edit field and one text view) as startup application, so that shouldn't take too long by itself.	I'll get back as soon as I tried out the other card."

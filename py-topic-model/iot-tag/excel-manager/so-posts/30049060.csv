Is it not a good idea to run the broker on the phone so that IoT devices could talk directly to the phone without going through some cloud server? Otherwise how else could the devices talk to the phone in an "offline" setting? Yes, the phone will have to be in range, of course. Will the phone have to be in hotspot mode?</p>	"

If this is for something like events etc where you also have the option of running the broker on a laptop this might be easier as it would be closer to a 'regular server'. You could have a separate WiFi access point or even use a phone as a WiFi hotspot to connect everything (bearing in mind you will need some sort of IP address discovery or local DNS resolution)"

Dynamodb could work, again depending on your requirements. Of course you should create the necessary indexes in dynamodb so you don't need to perform a table scan.</p>		<p>Depending on the number of devices and the frequency of updates you might be able to store the state in a relation database in RDS. Note this option is less scalable. To synchronize the data you would have an IOT rule forward to a lambda function that performs the database update.	With dynamodb you can have the rule forward directly into dynamodb.	Only do synchronization one way (i.e. Thing state -> database) to keep it simple. </p>		<p>Your other options are getting every thing shadow and filtering the results yourself.</p>	"

The problem now is that inside my blob container i have the following folder structure: 'name of iot hub'/01/year/month/day/random number?/blobfiles	I dont know where this structure is comming from. It got generated automatically it seems. Inside the blobs are my messages which is fine but the folder structure is weird.	Is there a way to delete all these unwanted folders? Deleting them wont help because with the next message they just come back.</p>		<p>Anyway i wanted to create a logic function with trigger when a blob is modified or added and selected the right storage container but the trigger never activates. why is this the case ? A http request for example works. But the blob trigger isnt. </p>		<p>Greetings,	Julian</p>	"

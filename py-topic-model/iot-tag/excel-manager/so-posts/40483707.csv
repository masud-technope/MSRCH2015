I have generated a java sdk. Do i use that sdk in my web portal or is it just for a device that sends telemetry data?</p>	"

There is no point in attaching sdk to your web application, as far as this part of the system doesn't treated as endpoint. It is bad practice to include endpoint sdk into the places, where lion's share of functionality would be ignored.</p>	"

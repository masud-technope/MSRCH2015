In the second step i change the protocol fielde as "MQTT".	Now whenever i request the measures from my device i take the correct value.	<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M1MSG.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M1MSG.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>	"

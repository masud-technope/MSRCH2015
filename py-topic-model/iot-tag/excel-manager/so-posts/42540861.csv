Also, my SIM is from an MVNO that says it has enabled roaming on Verizon.</p>		<p>I run <code>AT+COPS=?</code> and can see the Verizon network:</p>		<blockquote>	  <p>+COPS: (0,"T-Mobile","T-Mobile","310260",2),(0,"Verizon","Verizon","311480",7),(0,"T-Mobile","T-Mobile","310260",0),(0,"AT&amp;T","AT&amp;T","310410",7),(0,"AT&amp;T","AT&amp;T","310410",2),(0,"T-Mobile","T-Mobile","310260",7),,(0,1,2,3,4),(0,1,2)</p>	</blockquote>		<p>However when I run <code>AT+COPS=1,2,311480</code> I can't seem to register on the network.</p>		<p>Are there other AT commands required to register a roaming SIM on the Verizon network?  BTW through testing I've been able to register on T-Mobile and AT&amp;T.</p>	"

"7" indicates the radio access technology(RAT) and I remember 7 is LTE. </p>		<p>On the other hand, both AT&amp;T and T-Mobile has 2G/3G coverage, i.e. RAT 0 and 2. In your successful registration, you probably see the RAT is 0 or 2. You can use at!gstatus to check RAT.</p>		<p>I suspect your SIM card cannot roaming in Verizon LTE network. Usually international roaming agreement does not cover LTE.</p>	"

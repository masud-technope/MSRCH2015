The instructions given in the page at the link <a href="https://allseenalliance.org/framework/documentation/develop/building/linux" rel="nofollow">Alljoyn Building Linux</a> (<a href="https://allseenalliance.org/framework/documentation/develop/building/linux" rel="nofollow">https://allseenalliance.org/framework/documentation/develop/building/linux</a>) does not match the directory structure of the package downloaded. The instruction says that the directory should look like this:	root-source-dir/<br>	core/<br>	  --  alljoyn/<br>	  --  ajtcl/<br>	services/<br>	  --  base/<br>	  --  base_tcl/</p>		<p>However, the package's directory structure is quite different as follows:<br>	usr1@Ubuntu14p4LTS-HP1001:~/workspace/alljoyn/alljoyn-15.09.00a-src$<br> 	    drwxr-xr-x  8 usr1 usr1 4096 Nov 12 14:14 alljoyn_c <br>	    drwxr-xr-x 10 usr1 usr1 4096 Nov 12 14:14 alljoyn_core<br>	    drwxr-xr-x  9 usr1 usr1 4096 Nov 12 14:14 alljoyn_java<br>	    drwxr-xr-x  9 usr1 usr1 4096 Nov 12 14:14 alljoyn_js<br>	    drwxr-xr-x  8 usr1 usr1 4096 Nov 12 14:14 alljoyn_objc<br>	    drwxr-xr-x  4 usr1 usr1 4096 Nov 12 14:14 build_core<br>	    -rw-r--r--  1 usr1 usr1 3485 Nov 12 14:14 build.xml<br>	    drwxr-xr-x  7 usr1 usr1 4096 Nov 12 14:14 common<br>	    drwxr-xr-x  4 usr1 usr1 4096 Nov 12 14:14 external<br>	    -rw-r--r--  1 usr1 usr1  102 Nov 12 14:14 manifest.txt<br>	    -rw-r--r--  1 usr1 usr1 1363 Nov 12 14:14 README.md<br>	    -rw-r--r--  1 usr1 usr1  372 Nov 12 14:14 README.txt<br>	    -rw-r--r--  1 usr1 usr1 3996 Nov 12 14:14 SConstruct<br>	    drwxr-xr-x  3 usr1 usr1 4096 Nov 12 14:14 services<br>	    -rw-r--r--  1 usr1 usr1   38 Nov 12 14:14 tsan.supp<br></p>		<p>Also, the README.txt file from the root (alljoyn-15.09.00a-src) refer to these two files for build instructions but unfortunately, they cannot be found at the location given: "<strong>Build instructions</strong> are found in: <code>alljoyn_core/docs/BUILD.txt</code> (there is also and HTML version available in the directory)."</p>		<p>I think that missing are the build instructions README.txt and the SConstruct file specific to Alljoyn standard core v15.09a. I found the ones for v14.06.00a which I tried to extrapolate and use with 15.09a. I was able to get partially through but then quickly ran into some other build issues downstream due to some mismatch in the header files and cpp files.</p>		<p>Please help.	Thanks.</p>	"

I need a sensor on the first jump and another sensor on the last jump.	The first start time and the second stop time.	And then view time on a display or so.	I found this project that is alike what i want.	<a href="https://www.hackster.io/falafelsoftware/ir-break-beam-hot-wheels-car-speed-track-361455" rel="nofollow">https://www.hackster.io/falafelsoftware/ir-break-beam-hot-wheels-car-speed-track-361455</a></p>		<p>The sensor used in this <strong>Adafruit Breakbeam Sensor</strong>	<a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/ir-breakbeam-sensors/overview?view=all" rel="nofollow">https://learn.adafruit.com/ir-breakbeam-sensors/overview?view=all</a>	If i understand it correctly the range is only up to 50 cm.	A jumps width is normally 120 cm but it can be up to 140 cm.	So i need at least 120cm range.</p>		<p>I want to use a raspberry Pi and windows C#.	I have experience with c# and visual studio but this will be my first IOT project.</p>		<p>I am very thankful for any help and tips to build this. 	Specially tips on a sensor that will work for me.</p>	"

They are the same principle as the sensor you are looking at, but higher power.

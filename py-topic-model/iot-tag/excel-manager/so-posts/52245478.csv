I found some sample using AWS IoT SDK for python or JS. Is that the correct way to create a job for my firmware device via this SDK? </li>	<li>Also, is that the alternative way to update the firmware by using device shadow instead of creating a custom job in AWS IoT Console.</li>	</ol>		<p>I appreciate if any IoT job creation documentation or related sample link could be provided.</p>	"

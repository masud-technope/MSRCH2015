Sometimes the electric current goes down because we've too many devices connected and when the fridge is down for some days is not a good surprise when you discover this.</p>		<p>Do someone have a solution?</p>		<p>Thanks!</p>	"

The huge caveat is that GPIOs work of 3.5V low current DC, mains is 220V or 110V AC (depends which country) so you will probably need a Mains -> 3.5V DC supply between the mains and the RPI.</p>	"

In that i want to update three different table from node red dashboard based on user inputs.</p>		<p>So i want to access database more than 20 times. So i am using a database node from node-red-node-mysql palette in all 20 place. Now it is working fine. but if i  want to configure an another database then i need to change in all nodes in my flows. In real time also it is difficult. As just an idea, Is it possible to use only one database node for all my flows and split the output of the database to different nodes based on the message? If yes please give me some example. </p>	"

So you can wire many flows into a single `mysql` node, if that makes sense in your flows. If you update your question to include your flows exported as JSON, we can give you some more concrete examples of ways to simplify the flow..."

Make a connection to DB, in one place. Have it exposed to your API's. And always make sure it is closed after usage. That should be general approach."

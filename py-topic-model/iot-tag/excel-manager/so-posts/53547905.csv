53547905,93975893,53547915,3,0,Fri Nov 30 10:03:00 EST 2018,4799,"My feeling is that "yes" / "no" answers would be more appropriate as a comment, not an answer. An "no" answer should provide, for example, a work around. Don't you agree?"
53547905,93975951,53547915,3,0,Fri Nov 30 10:05:00 EST 2018,807126,"@akr My feeling is if the question can only be answered as a comment, then why is it a valid question at all?  How would the question be finalized with a canonical answer?"
53547905,93976350,53547915,3,0,Fri Nov 30 10:18:00 EST 2018,4799,"I really don't have have a strong opinion about this. If there is no work-around or alternative then obviously this is the final answer. It would just a bit more helpful with showing a solution. Anyway, I will remove my review."

It has a lot of the features you're probably looking for in a device manager. From there, there are data pipeline tools (like Google Cloud Functions, or Cloud Dataflow) which can ferry the telemetry data from your devices into Firebase (or, potentially a better option, Firestore).</p>		<p>I did a session at the Google Cloud Next conference this year (2018) which talked about the end-to-end IoT application, and we published the code we built on stage which includes IoT device management, and used Cloud Functions to push the data into Firestore if you're interested. Link can be found <a href="https://github.com/GabeWeiss/GoogleIoTCoreApp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. The Cloud Functions that moved the data into Firestore are in the gcf folder. The device folder has the Python code we used on device to send telemetry up to IoT Core.</p>	"

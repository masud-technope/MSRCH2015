It prescribes particular path structures (that numbers are used in paths, and what they mean) that represent the LwM2M object model to allow that unified management.</p>		<p>Compared to "plain CoAP", this limits the scope of what devices can do. Devices can still provide other CoAP functionality on the same server that is not covered by LwM2M. Those limitations allow different vendors to build devices that can interoperate with a different management servers, and LwM2M provides additional specifications for easy deployment (e.g. based on smart cards) that are out of scope for CoAP.</p>	"

The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation."</li>	<li><a href="https://www.omaspecworks.org/what-is-oma-specworks/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LwM2M</a> "is a device management protocol designed for sensor networks and the demands of a machine-to-machine (M2M) environment. With LwM2M, OMA  SpecWorks has responded to demand in the market for a common standard for managing lightweight and low power devices on a variety of networks necessary to realize the potential of IoT."</li>	</ul>		<p>Basically, we can simplify saying that CoAP was designed to communications between constrained IoT devices and it is very similar to HTTP protocol, which facilitates the developers work, while the LwM2M was designed mainly to manage constrained devices remotely, providing service enablement, for instance. Both protocols are commonly used together.</p>		<p>More information you can find in the following links:<br>	- <a href="https://www.telit.com/blog/what-is-lightweight-m2m-lwm2m/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">What is LwM2M?

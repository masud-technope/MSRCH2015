When i publish message with subscriber connected to broker, it successfully received by subscriber, now if I disconnect the subscriber , then again publish message and  connect subscriber after, I will be able to retrieve message those messages when my subscriber was offline.</p>		<p>My question is --</p>		<ol>	<li><p>Is there any storage in the broker which stores all the messages when subscriber is offline.</p></li>	<li><p>If yes, how much long or how many message it can store.</p></li>	<li><p>Is this approach is good for real time GPS tracking where subscriber can go offline for a long time (5-6 hr) approx.</p></li>	<li><p>Is session persistence is maintained even if power goes off.</p></li>	<li><p>How much traffic it can handle for scalable application if I use this approach in real time gps tracking..</p></li>	</ol>	"

You can control where this file is written to disk in the <a href="https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-conf-5.html" rel="nofollow">mosquitto.conf</a> file <code>autosave*</code> and <code>persistence*</code> options</p></li>	<li><p>Messages are stored as long as there are persistence sessions and the limit is disk space (or possibly 2-4gb for 32bit mosquitto). But either way that is a LOT of messages (unless you have stupidly large messages)</p></li>	<li><p>It depends on you message rates and the number of publishers/subscribers</p></li>	<li><p>Yes session persistence is kept in the same db file so state is maintained over mosquitto restarts</p></li>	<li><p>Again this really depends on how many publishers/subscribers you have and what the message rates are.</p></li>	</ol>	"

The interface should be defined on the pcl project, you must have a property where you will set the instance that implements this interface on your pcl project. On the console project you will implement the interface and assign the pcl exposed property to an instance of this implementation.</p>		<p>Other option is using a shared project instead of pcl you will be able to call it directly from your common project.</p>	"

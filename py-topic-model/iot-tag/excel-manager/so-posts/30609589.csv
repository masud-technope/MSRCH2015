I would now like to take a decision on the cloud and let the Arduino subscribe to a topic containing the decision message. For this, I am trying to use the <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/by6ev.jpg" rel="nofollow">IBM IOT out node</a> in my Node-RED editor. However, I am not sure of how to configure this node. </p>		<p>Are there any tutorials that cover this use-case (IBM IOT out node + Arduino, MQTT)- or documentation on the node properties?</p>		<p>Thanks.	NK</p>	"

The <code>msg.payload</code> will be the message you send to your Arduino.  You will also need to set the <code>topic</code> as well, the topic contains your <code>deviceId</code> also.  Then you will need to have your Arduino subscribe to the topic to receive the messages.</p>	"

Snapshot of the IBM IOT out node configuration and also of the client side code (Arduino?) if possible. OR link to IBM documentation that describes how to configure - I could not find relevant IBM documentation on my own."

Do you know how can I use LAG to get a previous value by time and not the last n event ?
For example when using a sliding window instead of tumbling window, if I use LAG, it will get me the previous value which is maybe 1s before.


I know I can just create 2 computations, one with tumbling and one with sliding window, but it would still be great to know if we can lookup into the past by unit of time and not unit of events."

While it's true, you could go straight to Pub/Sub for config, for example, if your device isn't connected when the config goes through, then your device won't get the update unless you write retry, etc. Also, security. You'd have to manage secure communication yourself without IoT Core."

If you said my device has an active connection, you mean if it stays connected with a long connection interval right ?
My device can't have any button to start advertising, so I guess It has to advertise each time first to post datas (since there is not only one slave)

A simple solution could be that a sender publish on a topic of the receiver and set inside it's payload information about the topic to reply and info about correlation.

The first step to increase performance would be to replace the computation of the `start` variable by `pass` (i.e. do nothing), and then compute `start` when you're out of the `while` loop. Same for `stop`. The next thing: `time.time()` might have a too low accuracy. The speed of sound is incredibly high, and thus you would need to messure in the microseconds"

(Please feel free to correct me) The way I see the node-RED application is  -- it contains nodes and connections between them. Each node should be deployed individually on each individual device and they talk with each other through some communication protocol (e.g., MQTT).

we used a mix of the propositions from @Alden : define several packet formats for the communication between device and backend + compress data like he offered to do.
since I wanted sthing done super quickly + use standard protocol/framework to be future proof (and I didn't want to risk reinventing the wheel by opening a TCP connection), we put those binaries in the body of an HTTP request, and we'll put it later in the body of a MQTT message"

I am still not very clear: by my understanding, anti-spoofing is something to identify the originator of the message is not cheated. In IoT hub case, if an attacker sends a message mimics some other device such as using that device's Id, then anti-spoofing is that IoT hub can identify this message is not actually from the tagged device (by Id) but is spoofed."

The devices you want to get data from are most probably already equipped with (or ready for being equipped with) a full network stack that allows you to send the data over the web. Your main effort would be to expose a web service and let the devices send data to it. If devices are sensors that have low or no access to power supply, I'd suggest to use simple UDP packets.

I dont think this option is feasible. The only interface RTI provide to integrate is webhook. I have to call the API, be it cloudant or my own. If you mean I should write a API just to parse the message before sending it to cloudant, I see it defeating the purpose of quick implementation of any application. RTI should be able to send right JSON to the POST API irrespective of the consumer."

You can change your service's security policy by going to Security > Connection Security and changing the default rule. ""TLS Optional"" will allow you to connect to 1883.

Yes, pi4j is the library for java to control the GPIO pin of raspberry pi, through that you can retrieve the value of the sensor attached to it. However, depending on the type of sensor, pi4j, as well as java, is not always the best. For example, ultrasonic sensor can be read easily by this way, however, temperature/humidity sensor such as DHT11. DHT22 has some problem with the timing in java, therefore it is best to use languages like C or Python."

Following your picture:
1) ""changes are pushed"": with Redis, the device could update variables as needed after any change,
2) ""data is polled"": with Redis, the application could read the variables periodically to collect changed.
And we might also take advantage of PUB/SUB to add notifications.
Having the device act as a client rather than a server would also be beneficial for us.

So, nothing seems to be lost by dropping Modbus."

The biggest issue will be finding a way to store the key in a separate location from the data itself. Often you can get around this by encrypting the data in the device and then storing it in an off-device database or storage bucket depending on your needs. It also depends on whether you are attempting to protect the data from physical or network based attackers."

You could also as a short-term solution use the public mqtt server, your device connects to that and subscribes to your chosen command topic. then in your web server you can use e.g. paho browser/javascript client to publish to the command topic.There are other more homegrown ways for handling a single device but as soon as you want to scale up these will get more complex. If all you ever want is a single device then a simple python socket server will probably suffice, make your web server connect to that to send a message. HTH Barny"

I believe matching the _exact_ international atomic-time to the microsecond is not that important. What you want is a reference 'beep' from the server, that all devices will receive at the same time. What I would do is just use [socket.io](http://socket.io/) and `socket.emit('beep')` to all clients. But even with this, they won't receive it _EXACTLY_ at the very same femtosecond, because you will always have network lag, slower device, etc."

A ring buffer is as likely to use pointers as any other solution.  This method is distinct from a ring buffer as it moves the data in memory rather than moving references to the data.  It is the use of memmove() that is peculiar to this solution.  It is functionally scalable to any size buffer, but decreases performance linearly.  By the time it takes longer to move the data than it takes to receive a character, it will fail. For large buffers it is a poor solution."

Because I have used `sizeof(buff)` throughout, the solution can be extended simply by changing the size of `buff`.  But be aware, this solution is specifically tailored to receiving a fixed number of characters before the `!`, it is not a general purpose serial buffering solution and not suited to variable length commands.

Ultimately the main benefit of decoupling when you have a strict build process is that a dependency-specific change is localized, even if you end up building everything.

You define a stateless method in the assemblies for configuration and on startup the composition root/bootstrapper in the main application passes that container in to each assembly method. This is acceptable as the IoC code is agnostic to what container it is passed, as opposed to referencing the container/composition root. The IoC code is also never referenced by anything but the bootstrapper. Hard coding would be referencing the container in your dependency objects, which is what would really be your ""source code""."

Would it make sense to store the data using column id's like so...

  Table: AssetData

And a relationship between these

How could we account for the native data type of each column, as nvarchar will have a significant impact on performance for us. Its not ideal for the data to be stored in JSON."

Then you could use arr reverse proxy to forward the request to the backend server. If you have multiple web servers, you could also modify the genrated url rewrite rule to create speical rule(with speical path in the url) to each differernt server. More details, you could refer to this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/url-rewrite-module/reverse-proxy-with-url-rewrite-v2-and-application-request-routing)."

Cause it isn't clear description of the method `close()` that says ""This must be called in order for the GPIO pin to be released and be available to other users."", what does it mean ""available to other users"", is it available to other application or available to use in scope of run application?"
